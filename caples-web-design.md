Hi, I’m Brandon, the designer and developer at Caples Web Design. I started this business in the spring of 2018 as a way to offer quality web design services to small businesses. Small business owners provide the backbone of the American economy; they’re shop owners, photographers, accountants, financial advisors, chiropractors, dentists, florists, restauranteurs, yogis, plumbers, and more. The list goes on.

I have worked directly with small businesses in a variety of industries, and what I’ve found is always the same: they want quality web solutions at affordable prices. Maybe you share their sentiment. You’re working with your own money, and you’re careful where you invest it. I get that. Maybe you want more than the cheap subscription services offer, but you’re not willing to spend a lot to pay a big marketing agency. I also get that.

## Marketing Experience

I have experience with small business marketing, and while I don’t offer marketing services directly, every website I build is crafted with my client’s business in mind. There is a wrong way to build a website, but you don’t need the marketing budget of a Fortune 500 company to get it right. It’s in my best interest for websites that I build to succeed, and that’s why I believe in overdelivering to my clients.

With my background in small business marketing, I’ve had my hands in many different types of marketing projects, like web design and development, search engine optimization (SEO), email marketing, graphic design, search engine marketing (SEM), video editing, event planning, and more. And now I’m happy to be providing clients with web solutions that work for them.

## Invest in Your Website

Your website is an investment. Even your domain name will increase in value the longer you use it. And the more you use your website, the more it can do for you and for your business.

So contact me with any questions. I’d love to talk about your website needs, even if you’re not sure which direction to go. I’m here to help.
