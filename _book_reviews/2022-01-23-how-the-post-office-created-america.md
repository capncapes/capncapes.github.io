In _How the Post Office Created America_, Winifred Gallagher explores the often overlooked role that the United States Postal Service played in shaping the nation's development and identity. Through meticulous research and a keen eye for historical detail, Gallagher presents a compelling argument that goes beyond the simple function of mail delivery to reveal the profound influence the postal system had on various aspects of American life.

If there’s one long-standing tradition that Americans take for granted, it’s the United States Postal Service, or USPS. Winifred Gallagher opens her book _How the Post Office Created America_ with the following statement:

<q>The history of its post office is nothing less than the story of America. Of the nation’s founding institutions, it is the least appreciated or studied, and yet for a very long time it was the U.S. government’s major endeavor. Indeed, it was that government in the experience of most citizens.</q>

Gallagher takes readers on a fascinating journey through history, tracing the evolution of the postal service from its humble beginnings to its pivotal role in connecting the vast expanse of the United States. She skillfully delves into the lives of key figures such as Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin Rush, shedding light on their involvement in shaping the postal system and recognizing its potential for promoting unity and communication among citizens. By highlighting their visionary efforts, Gallagher underscores the significance of the postal service as a unifying force during times of political, social, and economic upheaval.

The post began in Colonial America under its first postmaster, Richard Fairbanks, in 1639. Benjamin Franklin would later become a Colonial postmaster and help to innovate the new American post. Many other notable historical figures would contribute to the expansion and success of the post office, in both small and great ways.

## Benjamin Rush

Benjamin Rush (1746–1813)[^1] was instrumental in developing the United States postal services for the purposes of promoting literacy and circulating information among average citizens, rather than only the wealthy or people who happened to live near an existing post office.

Rush was a humanitarian who believed in the equal treatment of all people, pushing the idea that it was the government's obligation to provide free education from primary grades through college, based on his belief that an educated populace would enhance democratic society. He abhorred slavery and wrote a fiery essay in response to Christian justifications of American slavery, arguing that slavery stands in contradiction to Biblical teachings.

Because of his conviction that the government should provide adequate services to rich and poor alike, Rush was instrumental in the passing of the Post Office Act of 1792, which improved the postal service's infrastructure and operations and _paved new roads_[^2] for common access to information. He was concerned with the practical aspects of mail delivery, including the expansion of postal routes, the establishment of post offices in various regions, and the implementation of standardized rates and regulations.

> The Post Office Act helped turn the abstract idea of democracy into a concrete reality by authorizing mail service for the entire population rather than just the privileged few or the conveniently located.

One of the book's strengths lies in its ability to link the growth of the postal service with the development of American values and culture. Gallagher adeptly showcases how the postal network facilitated the exchange of ideas, information, and commerce, thereby fostering a sense of national identity and shared purpose. She also discusses the democratizing effect of affordable and reliable mail delivery, which allowed ordinary citizens to participate more actively in the civic and economic life of the nation. This insight provides readers with a fresh perspective on how the post office contributed to the egalitarian ideals that underpin the American ethos.

Furthermore, Gallagher skillfully navigates through the challenges and innovations that the postal service encountered over the centuries. She examines how the introduction of postage stamps, railway networks, and modern sorting technologies revolutionized mail distribution, turning it into a remarkably efficient and accessible system. This historical context adds depth to the narrative and helps readers appreciate the profound impact of seemingly minor changes on the fabric of society.

It’s astounding to consider how quickly the post office grew, beginning in Colonial America and expanding westward, forging new trails and building entire communities along the way.
