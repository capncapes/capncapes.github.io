On each episode of their <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-stuff-you-should-know-26940277/" target="_blank">podcast</a>, Josh and Chuck attempt to provide a foundational understanding of the subject matter&mdash;with varying degrees of accuracy. They are professional researchers, not experts on the topic at hand. But the allure of the podcast is found mostly in the chemistry between them, their frequent tangents and pop culture references, and the care they take to treat potentially sensitive topics with respect.

The book is the result of <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-stuff-you-should-know-26940277/episode/origami-folding-goodness-71502086/" target="_blank">folding the goodness</a> of the podcast into a rather nice-looking stack of pages and giving it an ISBN. The pages themselves have a nice feel to them as you’re flipping through the black and red text and illustrations. The illustrations throughout the book are the work of <a href="https://www.carlymonardo.com/" target="_blank">Carly Monardo</a>. Writer and editor Nils Parker also contributed to the writing of this book.
