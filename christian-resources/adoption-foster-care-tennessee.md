Most child welfare services are managed by individual states, so the laws, policies, and fees you experience may differ from what's shown here. All of these organizations serve Tennessee, but some of them serve several states. I hope these resources provide you with a good starting point, but you must ultimately conduct your own research based on applicable laws and where you live.

### Department of Children's Services, Tennessee (DCS)

[The Department of Children's Services](https://www.tn.gov/dcs/program-areas/foster-care-and-adoption.html) is the authority when it comes to adoption and foster care. Private agencies must contract with DCS to provide their services. The Department has more children in their care than any agency does, and fostering or adopting through DCS may streamline the process of applying and getting a child in your home. However, many agencies also provide support networks to help new foster and adoptive parents manage their home dynamics. Don't underestimate the value of a strong support network.

While many private agencies are understaffed and underfunded, this is even more true of DCS. It's not unheard of to be misled by DCS about the duration of a foster care placement, and turnover is high. According to [Tennessee Lookout](https://tennesseelookout.com/2021/08/06/workers-describe-unmanageable-caseloads-high-turnover-and-low-morale-at-department-of-childrens-services/), the turnover rate for DCS caseworkers is 22%. This isn't to discredit DCS, but to highlight the great need for additional public funding and even more private agency contract work, and to encourage potential foster parents to work with private agencies to avoid burnout due to stress.

### America's Kids Belong

Operating in multiple states, [America's Kids Belong](https://americaskidsbelong.org/) empowers <q cite="https://americaskidsbelong.org/">leaders in government, faith-based, business, and creative sectors to end the crisis for kids in foster care&mdash;state by state.</q>. For faith-based communities, America's Kids Belong encourages WRAP teams. Many churches already have WRAP ministries in place to support foster, kinship, and adoptive families in their communities. The WRAP program provides support by adding structure and intentionality to caring for these families. Volunteers request&mdash;and are assigned&mdash;roles working with a specific family to provide respite care (babysitting), meal trains, prayer, material needs, and other forms of support. [Read more about WRAP](https://www.tn.gov/tnfosters/how-you-can-help/faith-communities.html), and request additional information from [Tennessee Kids Belong](https://www.tnkidsbelong.org/support).

### Mercy Multiplied (Nashville, TN)

Mercy Ministries started in 1983 to provide alternative solutions to abortion for young women with seemingly no other options.
