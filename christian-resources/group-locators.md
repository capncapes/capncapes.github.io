## Precept

Founded by Jack and Kay Arthur in 1970, Precept has been resourcing people with Bible study materials for more than 50 years. Precept authors have written [inductive Bible studies on every book of the Bible](https://shop.precept.org/) and in a variety of formats&mdash;topical and by book, 40 minutes per week and more than an hour every day. Precept works in nearly 190 countries with materials in over 90 languages. The ministry aims to equip “small group Bible study leaders who can help you discover the truth of Scripture for yourself, but not by yourself.”

[Precept’s Bible study group locator](https://www.precept.org/group/find/) uses your location, or an address you enter, to find registered Bible studies within a specified distance. There are several filters to narrow your search, like the book being studied, start date, the group’s intended audience, group leader, and more. You can even search exclusively for [online Bible studies](https://www.precept.org/group/find/?location_type=Online).

## Bible Study Fellowship

Bible Study Fellowship (BSF) was founded in 1959 by Audrey Wetherell Johnson and serves more than 400,000 class members “of all ages and stages” in more than 120 nations. Bible study groups focus on one book or section of the Bible each year, studying chapter by chapter in 30 weekly sessions.

The [BSF study group locator](https://join.bsfinternational.org/) can find Bible study groups locally&mdash;in-person or online&mdash;or internationally, which are only available online. BSF does not sell Bible studies, but their WordGo app offers curriculum for individual and group study.
