title: Colossians
description: "Written to the Colossian church, this short letter by the apostle Paul is overflowing with Christology. The church at Colossae (a.k.a. Colosse) was in a small town located in the Lycus river valley, within the Phrygian region in Asia. Many scholars agree that Paul did not start this church, and that it was likely Epaphras who planted and pastored the church. The letter was written was Paul to address a heresy that had arisen, but the specific false belief is not mentioned&mdash;only Paul's response, which is to affirm the deity of Jesus Christ. Paul also addresses a few other points, with his primary concern being the proper place of Christ as central to the believer's life: &ldquo;the substance is Christ&rdquo; (2:17, CSB)."
