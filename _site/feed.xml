&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-systematic-theology&quot;&gt;What is systematic theology?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface, systematic theology may seem very dry, as if the stories and messages found within the Bible are pulled out and systematized into stale Latin phrases by dead theologians. But systematic theology is much richer. It’s a way of studying a subject in context throughout the entirety of Scripture, attending to the cohesiveness of texts separated by thousands of years, dozens of authors, and multiple languages and cultures. In his lecture introducing systematic theology, Scott R. Swain highlights four key principles: unity, scope, proportion, and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unity&quot;&gt;Unity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do the books of the Bible relate to one another to form a unified message? &lt;q&gt;In systematic theology, we ask not just, ‘What does Paul say in Romans,’ but, ‘how does what Paul says in Romans relate to what Moses says in Exodus?’&lt;/q&gt; Furthermore, the principle of unity in systematic theology also attempts to relate the teachings of the Bible with science and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;full-scope&quot;&gt;Full scope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systematic theology attempts to read and interpret Scripture in light of the rest of Scripture. In Acts 20, while addressing the elders of the church in Ephesus, Paul declares that he &lt;q&gt;did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.&lt;/q&gt; (v. 27, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dutch Reformed theologian Herman Bavinck (1854–1921) noted that failure to observe the full scope of Scripture &lt;q&gt;leads to one-sidedness and error in theology and pathology in the religious life.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;proportions&quot;&gt;Proportions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott Swain illustrates the point that systematic theology observes biblical proportions in this way: &lt;q&gt;The Bible says something about everything… But the Bible doesn’t say everything about everything.&lt;/q&gt; There are first-order matters and second-order matters in Scripture.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As Paul points out in 1 Corinthians 15&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the gospel is a matter of first importance. And though the Bible frequently mentions animals of various kinds, biblical information about animals is a matter of much lower importance than what the Bible says about human salvation. Systematic theology attempts to define those distinctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relationships&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth principle of systematic theology is concerned with the relationships between various doctrines. Swain uses the examples of good works and grace. Both of these doctrines are important to the Christian life. But how do good works and grace interact with each other? &lt;q&gt;If we think that good works are the basis for God’s grace, we’re going to get ourselves in all kinds of trouble.&lt;/q&gt; That’s because good works come after grace, not before. Systematic theology studies the relationships between doctrines in order to clarify each doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; not by works, so that no one can boast. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 2:8–10, &lt;abbr title=&quot;New International Version&quot;&gt;NIV&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scripture&quot;&gt;Scripture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can the study of systematic theology tell us about Scripture? Is the Bible reliable and authoritative? Is it inspired by God or just a collection of writings by mortal men? Since all theological study necessarily deals primarily with holy texts, the study of Scripture itself is a good place to start. Swain employs three passages in order to observe how the Bible’s authors viewed Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;god-is-pleased-to-reveal-himself-to-us-in-order-that-we-might-find-rest-in-him&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;God is pleased to reveal himself to us in order that we might find rest in him.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; At that time Jesus said, &lt;q&gt;I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do. &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 11:25–30, NIV&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 11, we discover that the Godhead—Father, Son, Holy Spirit—are complete in their unity of knowledge and love with one another. This passage also teaches us that the Father delights in making himself known to his children. This knowledge of God that is revealed to us is not only for God’s good pleasure, but also so that we may find rest in him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q cite=&quot;Augustine of Hippo&quot;&gt;You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in You.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
— Augustine, &lt;em&gt;Confessions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;god-is-pleased-to-reveal-himself-to-us-in-a-twofold-manner&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;God is pleased to reveal himself to us in a twofold manner.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; For the director of music. A psalm of David.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The heavens declare the glory of God;&lt;br /&gt;
the skies proclaim the work of his hands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Day after day they pour forth speech;&lt;br /&gt;
night after night they reveal knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; They have no speech, they use no words;&lt;br /&gt;
no sound is heard from them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Yet their voice goes out into all the earth,&lt;br /&gt;
their words to the ends of the world.&lt;br /&gt;
In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,&lt;br /&gt;
like a champion rejoicing to run his course.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; It rises at one end of the heavens&lt;br /&gt;
and makes its circuit to the other;&lt;br /&gt;
nothing is deprived of its warmth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; The law of the Lord is perfect,&lt;br /&gt;
refreshing the soul.&lt;br /&gt;
The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy,&lt;br /&gt;
making wise the simple.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; The precepts of the Lord are right,&lt;br /&gt;
giving joy to the heart.&lt;br /&gt;
The commands of the Lord are radiant,&lt;br /&gt;
giving light to the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; The fear of the Lord is pure,&lt;br /&gt;
enduring forever.&lt;br /&gt;
The decrees of the Lord are firm,&lt;br /&gt;
and all of them are righteous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; They are more precious than gold,&lt;br /&gt;
than much pure gold;&lt;br /&gt;
they are sweeter than honey,&lt;br /&gt;
than honey from the honeycomb.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; By them your servant is warned;&lt;br /&gt;
in keeping them there is great reward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; But who can discern their own errors?&lt;br /&gt;
Forgive my hidden faults.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Keep your servant also from willful sins;&lt;br /&gt;
may they not rule over me.&lt;br /&gt;
Then I will be blameless,&lt;br /&gt;
innocent of great transgression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart&lt;br /&gt;
be pleasing in your sight,&lt;br /&gt;
Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 19, NIV&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Psalm 19, we can decipher two “books” by which we can know God: the book of nature and the book of Scripture. The Belgic Confession reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We know Him by two means: First, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe; which is before our eyes as a most elegant book, wherein all creatures, great and small, are as so many characters leading us to see clearly the invisible things of God, even his everlasting power and divinity, as the apostle Paul says (Romans 1:20). All which things are sufficient to convince men and leave them without excuse. Second, He makes Himself more clearly and fully known to us by His holy and divine Word, that is to say, as far as is necessary for us to know in this life, to His glory and our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Belgic Confession, Article 2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theological term “general revelation” is typically used of the work of the book of nature, while theologians use “special revelation” to describe knowledge that comes from the inspired Word of God, the book of Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In verses 1–6 of Psalm 19, the natural world is said to &lt;q&gt;declare the glory of God&lt;/q&gt; (v. 1) and the psalmist makes use of metaphorical language to describe the eagerness of the sun to warm the whole earth. That’s general revelation, which describes human observance of the splendor of nature. General revelation is available to all audiences, but it is incomplete and cannot, by itself, bring us into a relationship with God. That’s where special revelation comes in. The psalmist references human anatomy in verses 7 and 8 to illustrate the incompleteness of the parts on their own &lt;em&gt;until&lt;/em&gt; they are brought together by the work of God’s law, statutes, and precepts. The soul, mind (v. 7), heart, and eyes (v. 8), themselves works of nature, are given refreshment, wisdom, joy, and light when introduced to the special revelation of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does Psalm 19 show us how these two books speak to us about God, but the psalmist also teaches us how we should speak back to God. In verses 12 and 13, he says, &lt;q&gt;But who can discern their own errors? Forgive my hidden faults. Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me.&lt;/q&gt; The psalmist, King David, acknowledges that he is out of step with the rest of nature in glorifying God—both unintentionally and willfully sinning against the Lord. Finally, in verse 14, he says, &lt;q&gt;May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.&lt;/q&gt; David knows that he cannot earn God’s favor, but he appeals to God’s graciousness in his relationship with his creator. Though I am a sinner, may the words I speak and the reflections of my heart demonstrate a deep love for God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;until-jesus-returns-the-bible-is-our-supreme-source-of-special-revelation&quot;&gt;“Until Jesus returns, the Bible is our supreme source of special revelation”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, &lt;q&gt;This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.&lt;/q&gt; &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain. &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things. &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Peter 1:16–21, NIV&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible is God’s inspired word, and Dr. Swain points to this passage from the apostle Peter’s second letter as the best declaration in Scripture of the Bible’s own inspiration. He notes two things that this passage teaches us. (There are actually more than two.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that this passage teaches is that prophets and apostles had &lt;q&gt;special access&lt;/q&gt; to God’s revelations. They did not simply interpret events happening around them as being related in some way to God, filling in the gaps of their observations with contrivances. Secondly, each prophet and apostle had a special anointing from the Holy Spirit, allowing them to remember what they saw and &lt;q&gt;reliably communicate it to us.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This passage also affirms the unity of Scripture. What the prophets foretold, the apostles witnessed. As Swain notes toward the end of his lecture, &lt;q&gt;All of Scripture holds together as a testimony to Christ.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible is inspired. It’s unified. And it’s sufficient. Earlier in the chapter, Peter writes, &lt;q&gt;His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life &lt;strong&gt;through our knowledge of him&lt;/strong&gt; who called us by his own glory and goodness&lt;/q&gt; (v. 3, emphasis added). In addition, Scripture is reliable and authoritative (v. 19). It’s also clear. The Bible is not always clear, as Peter himself acknowledges later in this letter&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but the basic message of Scripture is clear: God desires for humanity to know him and share in his rest, and his love for us is so great that he redeemed us for union with himself forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott Swain’s final point looks to the second half of verse 19: &lt;q&gt;…as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.&lt;/q&gt; Scripture is our supreme source of special revelation &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;—until the second advent of Christ. As we await with eagerness &lt;q&gt;the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ&lt;/q&gt; (Titus 2:13, NIV), we have at present &lt;q&gt;a lamp for [our] feet, a light on [our] path&lt;/q&gt; (Psalm 119:105, NIV).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible is inspired, unified, sufficient, reliable, authoritative, and clear. Scripture is &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; God, &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; God, and leads us &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; God, where we &lt;q&gt;will find rest for [our] souls&lt;/q&gt; (Matthew 11:29). Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are certainly matters of even lower importance. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.&lt;/q&gt; (1 Corinthians 15:3–5, ESV) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Speaking of Paul, Peter writes, &lt;q&gt;His letters contain some things that are hard to understand.&lt;/q&gt; (2 Peter 3:16, NIV) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But when God interrupts me, it’s obvious. That’s what happened in the middle of corporate worship on a Sunday morning in July. I experienced the Holy Spirit comforting me in the midst of anxiety, self-doubt, and impatience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feeling was the same as what I felt five years ago when I learned that my first child had died in the womb: despair, longing, and hope. Upon hearing confirmation of my son’s stillbirth, I was overcome by a strange and conflicting sense of sadness and hope—hope that I would yet know the joy of the Lord. And I did. I learned a great deal about joy in the midst of sorrow, pain, and longing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;losing-ezra-james&quot;&gt;Losing Ezra James&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That September day in 2017, as I paced the hospital room, waiting and hoping for a miracle for my unborn child, all I could do was pray. After more than two hours and several medical tests, my wife’s doctor walked in and confirmed the worst: there was no heartbeat; my son was gone. In the moments following, my mind briefly ran to panic, then immediately to sadness. Within a second or two of realizing that my son was dead, I heard a song playing in my head—frustratingly in the front of my grief-stricken mind. It was the song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyIGnuDwBKA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Joy of the Lord&lt;/em&gt;, by Twila Paris&lt;/a&gt;, which we sang in my church growing up. It was the most perplexing song to hear at that moment, and I hated myself at the time for thinking of it. It was only a few hours later that I realized that the Holy Spirit had put that familiar song on my mind at just the right time to remind me that true joy isn’t dependent upon circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joy of the Lord&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;—that peculiar, hope-filled, abiding, content-in-all-circumstances portion—is found in the dark places of our lives, when we come to terms with the reality that there’s no redemption on our own, no reconciling our own past or present or future, no walking out of the darkness ourselves, because it’s Jesus who redeems us, who saves us, is saving us, and will save us, and who carries us out of the darkest moments of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small mercy from the loss of my son, Ezra James Caples, was that he was born perfect—without visible bodily damage. Not every angel&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; has the same outcome. We get to treasure beautiful pictures of a baby who looks alive. As I held his lifeless body, I was overwhelmed with feelings of longing, despair, grief, anger. And joy. I kept thinking, &lt;q&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is my son, my child.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/q&gt; I couldn’t keep from smiling at my firstborn. I loved him so much at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our entire church showed up at the funeral, and we sang &lt;em&gt;The Joy of the Lord&lt;/em&gt; among the trees and grave markers in Nashville, Tennessee. It was a hot day for September, and the mosquitoes were hungry. But the biting sense of unfairness stung the most. Why did God give us so much happiness during the pregnancy months, only to take away our only child? Human suffering is a difficult topic and not one I’m attempting to address here, but I’ve learned to trust God and pursue joy in the wake of grief. God has been good to me, and I can’t say much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;anxiety&quot;&gt;Anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always dealt with social anxiety. I was a shy kid who never spoke up in class unless I was called on. (And being called on in class was terrifying.) I’ve been that way for as long as I can remember. I manage it better now, but I still feel tense around people I don’t know well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pushing-grief-aside&quot;&gt;Pushing grief aside&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February of 2018, I quit my job without another one lined up—uncharacteristic for me. It had only been five months since losing Ezra, but my wife suggested I quit the job I hated in order to take some time to grieve. We had also been doing grief counseling, which really helped me in many ways, one of which was realizing that I had been operating as if I hadn’t just experienced a loss. I had returned to work one week after my son’s stillbirth and, in many ways, acted like I needed to be strong for my wife—without taking time to grieve myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had some pent-up bitterness toward the people around me—my co-workers—for not responding to my grief in the ways that I thought I needed. It felt like none of them even cared about my pain. That was a very unfair burden to place on a group of people who really didn’t know me very well. And even if they had, grief manifests in ways that surprise even the griever. Another lesson from therapy: Most people mean well, but they still don’t know how to respond to someone else’s grief. I’ve found this is doubly true when people don’t know how to categorize a loss—like stillbirth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;health-fears&quot;&gt;Health fears&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that month, I came down with a virus of some kind. I remember lying on the couch, struggling to breathe and seriously wondering if I would suffocate. We drove to the hospital, where I spent the next three days recovering from myocarditis, a condition marked by inflammation of the heart muscle. The viral infection had triggered an immune response in my heart. Though my heart wouldn’t give me any more real trouble after that (so far), I couldn’t shake the anxiety that had weaponized my diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to 2020: The COVID-19 pandemic has been hard on everyone, in many different ways. 6.6 million deaths worldwide&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, countless medical after-effects, relationships forever lost, abuse of all kinds on the rise, anxiety and depression skyrocketing. The toll is much larger than statistics can bear. And I was afraid for much of the pandemic—for my health, for my wife and living child&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and for my job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the last few years struggling with anxiety about my heart health, my family’s health, my job, the global pandemic, and other concerns. Anxiety can be hard to shake. It’s not logical, and you can’t reason your way out of it—at least I haven’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jesus-friend-of-the-anxious&quot;&gt;Jesus, friend of the anxious&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of silence from God—or more likely, closed ears on my part—he spoke to me in an elementary school gym as the congregation sang. But it wasn’t words that were communicated, only a feeling of comfort, as if El Roi, &lt;em&gt;the God who sees&lt;/em&gt;, were wrapping me in his arms and whispering, &lt;q&gt;I’ve got you.&lt;/q&gt; It was simple and not particularly profound, but I couldn’t hold back my tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sermon that day was on Psalm 25, an acrostic poem by David. In this psalm, David appeals multiple times to God to save him from his sins and his enemies. As in many of his psalms, David seems very anxious, recognizing the very real dangers of both his sinfulness and the malice of his enemies. Three times he mentions waiting for Yahweh (vv. 3, 5, 21). The transliterated word for &lt;q&gt;wait&lt;/q&gt; here is &lt;em&gt;qavah&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;span dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;קָוָה&lt;/span&gt;), which connotes both waiting and hoping. But the hope is not simply &lt;em&gt;wishing for something to happen&lt;/em&gt;; it’s waiting &lt;em&gt;in expectation that it will happen&lt;/em&gt;. David’s hope in the Lord is an expectation of his salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe it’s the same with anxiety. I’m waiting on the Lord and hoping in his promise of deliverance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Turn to me and be gracious to me,&lt;br /&gt;
for I am alone and afflicted.&lt;br /&gt;
The distresses of my heart increase;&lt;br /&gt;
bring me out of my sufferings.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 25:16–17, CSB&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-worry&quot;&gt;“Don’t worry”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up believing that anxiety is sinful, but I don’t think it’s that simple. In Matthew 6, Jesus teaches us not to worry (&lt;q&gt;be anxious&lt;/q&gt;) about our lives (vv. 25–34), but I think this is more a comfort than a command. Consider how he illustrates the Father’s care for the birds (v. 26) and the wildflowers (vv. 28–30). Our heavenly Father knows our needs (v. 32), and he provides for his creation—the same creation over which humanity has dominion (Genesis 1:26). How much more, then, will he provide for his beloved children? Jesus offers comfort to those afflicted with anxiety, worry, and fear. &lt;q&gt;Therefore don’t worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.&lt;/q&gt; (v. 34) Truly, his &lt;q&gt;yoke is easy and [his] burden is light.&lt;/q&gt; (Matthew 11:30).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew 6:25–34 is directly linked to the preceding verses (19–24). This passage isn’t just about greed and material wealth. When we fix our eyes on anything but Jesus, our &lt;q&gt;treasure in heaven,&lt;/q&gt; the instability of those things will inevitably lead us into anxiety. For our eyes to be healthy, we must look to the Light, not gaze into the darkness and wonder about the security of our health, beauty, intelligence, wealth, relationships, and abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who say, &lt;q&gt;Jesus never had anxiety&lt;/q&gt; have not closely read Luke 22, when Jesus sweated blood while praying &lt;q&gt;in anguish&lt;/q&gt; in the Garden of Gethsemane&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (vv. 39–46&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Sweating blood is actually a very rare condition called hematidrosis that can be caused by intense stress. Jesus, knowing his destiny, was very anxious about going to the cross. He understands our anxieties and fears. &lt;q&gt;Therefore, let us approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in time of need.&lt;/q&gt; (Hebrews 4:16, CSB)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could argue that being under intense stress for a few hours is not the same as prolonged anxiety—it’s not—but Jesus experiencing anxiety, even briefly, is enough to establish that, not only is anxiety not sinful, it’s also common. I hope we can find some comfort in that. Jesus, being &lt;q&gt;without sin,&lt;/q&gt; (Hebrews 4:15)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; could not have experienced anxiety if it were a sin to do so. More than that, he understands our struggles with anxiety. Your fears and worries are not sinful, but Jesus still calls us away from the yoke of anxiety. I choose to believe it’s possible, even if incredibly difficult, to unburden ourselves from chronic worry, stress, anxiety, and fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not there yet, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-to-listenand-talk&quot;&gt;Learning to listen—and talk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After moving away from the community that loved us well, at quite possibly the worst time to relocate—December of 2019—I’ve spent the last three years disconnected. I’ve realized that I’m not quite as introverted as I thought, and I need to listen to my own longing for connectivity. I work from home in a quiet suburban neighborhood, doing mostly solo work, in a city where I still know very few people. It can be lonely, which is why I’m once again pursuing therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, my anxiety is much less of a burden—for now. (Thank you, Wonderful Counselor!) I’m not a mental health expert by any means, and I don’t intend to suggest that prayer is a guaranteed prescription for anxiety. It’s not. But prayer is a crucial component in my personal anxiety journey, along with therapy&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and attention to my personal and interpersonal needs. Daily prayer, good nutrition, regular exercise, keeping caffeine in check, professional counseling, social presence, recreation. These are all ways that I’ve found to meaningfully cope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My social anxiety is not gone, though some of my other worries are. And I still miss Ezra; I hung his ornament on our Christmas tree yesterday. There are fewer triggers for my grief now, but the holidays can still be heavy. Christmas is joyful, fun, and spiritual, but the season still reminds me that I have two children, and only one of them can eat his gingerbread house face-first, hum Christmas music while decorating the tree, and cuddle up to holiday cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I feel more hopeful than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

With so many products and services, millions of people use Google. But what if you like your existing email address? You can create a Google account without Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially useful when using Google’s business services, like Search Console, Google Ads, Google Analytics, etc. It’s a really nice way to compartmentalize your personal and work accounts and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Google services, like Google Ads, allow administrators to restrict users to those with specific email domains, such as those of your business. For Ads, this is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375456?hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;font-bold&quot;&gt;Allowed Domains&lt;/a&gt;. But you must also have a Google account to use these products, which is exactly how I ended up creating my new non-Gmail account this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail&lt;/a&gt; to get started. Fill out the form (pictured below) using the email address that you want to use when signing into your new Google account.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/martech/create-your-google-account.png&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot; alt=&quot;Create your Google account without Gmail&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After clicking &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;, update your new account with additional information, like your gender and birthdate. Next, verify that you’re human by completing the CAPTCHA. Agree to Google’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy by checking the corresponding box. Now click &lt;strong&gt;Next step&lt;/strong&gt; to submit the form and create your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your Google account created, you will now need to confirm that you own the email address provided. Go to your email inbox and look for an email from Google. Click the link inside to confirm your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can sign into your new Google account, and the email address username is your non-Gmail address!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brandon Caples</name></author><category term="MarTech" /><category term="Google" /><summary type="html">Did you know that you can have a Google account without a Gmail address?

If you don’t know what it is, this file could be alarming. Don’t worry; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt; is harmless. But it can be annoying when it shows up in every folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-ds_store-file&quot;&gt;What is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt; file?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt; is a hidden metadata file exclusive to Mac computers, though you could possibly come across it on a Windows PC that is sharing project code with a Mac. The file simply contains information specific to the folder it’s in: folder color, icon size, window size, file order, etc. The file is created the first time you select any View Options for a folder, but it’s hidden using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; prefix. However, you can see it in the terminal using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; command. And of course, it also shows up in Git repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-remove-ds_store-files-from-a-git-repository&quot;&gt;How to remove &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt; files from a Git repository&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove (and prevent) &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt; from your project code, I recommend first checking out a new branch with the following command: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git checkout -b [BRANCH-NAME]&lt;/code&gt;. Then make sure you’re in the root of your project folder so that your changes will affect the whole project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remove-ds_store&quot;&gt;Remove &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the following terminal command to find all previously committed &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt; files and remove them from your project. If &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git rm&lt;/code&gt; makes you uneasy, you can perform a dry run to check the files that would be removed, without actually removing anything. To do this, add either &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--dry-run&lt;/code&gt; as a flag following &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt;, like this: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;... git rm -n --ignore-unmatch&lt;/code&gt;. Once you’ve seen what will be removed, repeat the full command without the flag to remove &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt; from your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-console&quot; data-lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm --ignore-unmatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;add-to-gitignore&quot;&gt;Add to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt; from entering your project’s code again, add &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;**/.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt; to your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file. If it does not exist, create the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file in the root of your project folder and add &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;**/.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt; on its own line. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; part of the command tells Git that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt; files should be ignored in every folder of your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;commit-changes&quot;&gt;Commit changes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commit your changes and push them to your remote repository. If you review the changes made in your version control host, you’ll notice that the updates remove all the instances of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt;, along with adding that line to your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brandon Caples</name></author><category term="MarTech" /><category term="web development" /><category term="Git" /><summary type="html">Every developer with a Mac computer has encountered the .DS_Store file in their Git code.

&lt;p&gt;This passage is the beginning of the longest recorded prayer of Jesus, and it’s filled with love for his disciples—all of us throughout history. As Gary M. Burge notes, &lt;q&gt;John 17 gives us a glimpse into the heart of Jesus unlike any other chapter in the four Gospels.&lt;/q&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The NIV Application Commentary: John&lt;/em&gt;) Dane Ortlund takes it further in his book, &lt;a href=&quot;/book-reviews/gentle-and-lowly&quot; class=&quot;italic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gentle and Lowly&lt;/a&gt;, when he describes Christ’s bottomless well of grace: &lt;q&gt;Jesus Christ is comforted when you draw from the riches of his atoning work, because his own body is getting healed.&lt;/q&gt; Jesus desires for his people to not only be with him eternally, but to come to him now, in this age, for grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to unpack in just these five verses, but one phrase that is often overlooked is, “This is eternal life: that they may know you” (v. 3). Louis Berkhof describes the nature of eternal life in his major theological treatise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The reward of the righteous is described as eternal life, that is, not merely an endless life, but life in all its fulness, without any of the imperfections and disturbances of the present, Matt. 25:46; Rom. 2:7. The fulness of this life is enjoyed in communion with God, which is really the essence of eternal life, Rev. 21:3. They will see God in Jesus Christ face to face, will find full satisfaction in Him, will rejoice in Him, and will glorify Him.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Louis Berkhof, Systematic Theology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eternal life is not simply living forever, nor does it begin once the faithful believer dies. The gift of eternal life is complete and everlasting union with the fullness of God in Jesus Christ, face to face. Even better, it begins in this life. If eternal life, as defined by Christ himself, is to know God, then those of us who know God are experiencing it now. Eternal life for the Christian bleeds backward into time. Just as a door can be opened to let in the sunshine while a person is still inside, so too, can the Christian experience the warmth of the Son in this present life. And how much better to finally pass through that open door into the fresh air of God’s full glory? (Philippians 1:12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;obstacles-to-experiencing-eternal-life-now&quot;&gt;Obstacles to experiencing eternal life now&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many obstacles to experiencing the warmth of Jesus in this present life. To continue with the open door analogy, there’s a lot happening in this room. Life gets busy and distracting. Our bodies and minds are imperfect, plaguing us with physical and mental sicknesses. Anxiety, depression, cancer, eating disorders, insomnia. Evil abounds, striving always to turn our eyes and hearts away from Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These “imperfections and disturbances,” as Berkhof calls them, can be seriously heavy burdens. It would be dismissive to suggest that the person struggling with depression simply have more faith, though. God chooses to work primarily through his creation, and we’re not meant to live the Christian life alone. &lt;q cite=&quot;Galatians 6:2, CSB&quot;&gt;Carry one another’s burdens,&lt;/q&gt; (Galatians 6:2, CSB) and allow others to carry yours. Seek professional help, if needed, to manage the things that might prevent you from experiencing the Son of God presently. &lt;strong&gt;It is not a weak faith that treats &lt;em&gt;fill-in-the-blank&lt;/em&gt; with health providers, prescribed medication, or licensed therapists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;look-to-the-second-coming&quot;&gt;Look to the second coming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Christians, our hope is found in Jesus and his second coming to restore all things to perfection. We are told to watch and pray in anticipation of the second coming of Christ, &lt;q cite=&quot;Jude 21, CSB&quot;&gt;waiting expectantly for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for eternal life.&lt;/q&gt; (Jude 21, CSB)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brandon Caples</name></author><category term="Faith" /><category term="eternal life" /><category term="eschatology" /><category term="gospels" /><summary type="html">“Is this real life?” David After Dentist is a hilarious viral video of a 7-year old boy fresh out of a dental procedure who is clearly still feeling the effects of nitrous oxide, or laughing gas.

How would it feel to receive a personal letter from that person commending you for your faith and revealing their prayers for you? That is how the church in Colossae must have felt to receive a letter from the apostle Paul. By the time he wrote Colossians, Paul was well-known in the growing Christian movement, and Colossae was a small city with little influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul did not plant the Colossian church; he likely never even visited it. But he had heard about their “faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints” (1:4) through Epaphras. Epaphras is probably the one who started the Colossian church, and the minister of Christ who “told us about your love in the Spirit.” (1:8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letter to the Colossians is rich with theology. N. T. Wright notes, &lt;q&gt;Faced with a young church in a small town in up-country Asia Minor, Paul has written a letter in which he has distilled his understanding of some of the greatest themes in theology.&lt;/q&gt; (Wright, 40)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There’s so much to discuss in Colossians, but Paul’s brief mention of ministering to the church in 1:24–29 can be a particularly tricky passage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church, &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints. &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone mature in Christ. &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; For this I toil, struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works within me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Colossians 1:24–29, &lt;abbr title=&quot;English Standard Version&quot;&gt;ESV&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rejoicing-in-sufferings&quot;&gt;Rejoicing in sufferings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul begins this passage by rejoicing in his sufferings &lt;q&gt;for your [the church’s] sake&lt;/q&gt; (v. 24) He rejoices in his sufferings elsewhere in his writings&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so this is not strange. Paul understands that he must suffer (Acts 9:16) along with all Christians, but Wright believes Paul to be &lt;q&gt;drawing the enemy’s fire on to himself&lt;/q&gt; (p. 89) as a way to relieve the young Colossian church of excess affliction. Personally, I see the clause “for your sake” as qualifying the rejoicing, not the suffering. Students of Greek grammar can correct me if I’m wrong, but I might re-write it this way: &lt;q&gt;Now I rejoice, for your sake, in my sufferings…&lt;/q&gt; With this rendering, Paul would be modeling joy in suffering for a young church already struggling with how to live as Christians. I have to admit, though, both interpretations seem very reasonable to me and align with Paul’s character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;does-paul-provide-what-is-lacking-in-christs-afflictions&quot;&gt;Does Paul provide what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of verse 24 is strange and difficult:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;… and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church…&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could be lacking in Christ’s afflictions? Is Paul suggesting that the atonement on the cross is somehow incomplete? &lt;em&gt;I have to admit that I don’t clearly understand Paul’s meaning here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard the interpretation that what’s lacking is gospel preaching—that since Jesus is no longer on the earth, Paul is picking up his preaching where he left off. This exposition seems incomplete to me. It’s true that Jesus is no longer physically preaching to people, but that doesn’t seem to create “lack” in Christ’s afflictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I fall more in line with how N. T. Wright and others interpret this passage. The church will necessarily suffer as Christ himself suffered. What is lacking in Christ’s afflictions is continued suffering. Christ no longer endures trials, temptations, and abuse in this world; his suffering has ended. But our suffering—the trials of believers around the world and through the ages—continues, and Paul &lt;q&gt;is filling up&lt;/q&gt; whatever contains all the Christian suffering, by enduring an excess amount, yet joyfully. This interpretation aligns well with Wright’s explanation for Paul’s suffering in the first half of verse 24.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mystery&quot;&gt;The mystery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1:25–27, Paul next refers to himself as a minister to the church—both the larger body of Christ and the Colossian church, which likely was mostly Gentile converts. In verse 25, he mentions his stewardship from God &lt;q&gt;to make the word of God fully known&lt;/q&gt; and calls it &lt;q&gt;the mystery hidden for ages and generations&lt;/q&gt; (ESV). These verses are strikingly similar to part of Paul’s letter to the church in Ephesus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 3:7–10, ESV&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both passages, Paul states that he was made a minister to the church by God for the sake of the Gentiles, he mentions the riches of Christ, and he proclaims the &lt;q&gt;mystery hidden for ages&lt;/q&gt; which he has been charged with sharing. The mystery here should not be thought of by the English definition of a mystery, as a puzzle or perplexity. N. T. Wright notes, &lt;q&gt;In their looking forward to the day when God would act in history to restore the fortunes of his people, some Jewish seers expressed their hopes in terms of the ‘secret plans’ that God was reserving for the last great day.&lt;/q&gt; The plans of Yahweh are alluded to throughout the Old Testament but are now revealed to all God’s people. These plans are not a timeline of events, however, but a person: Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;christ-in-you-the-hope-of-glory&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Christ in you, the hope of glory&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Christology of Colossians 1:15–20 is amplified in the words, &lt;q&gt;Christ in you, the hope of glory&lt;/q&gt; (v. 27) Paul expands on this ancient mystery which is revealed to the Gentiles (not just the people of Israel!): Messiah (Christ) lives in/among you (plural), which is your hope of future glory.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Of the “riches” of verse 27, Wright notes, &lt;q&gt;Among these treasures is the fact that God’s glory is to be &lt;em&gt;shared&lt;/em&gt; with his people (&lt;em&gt;cf.&lt;/em&gt; Rom. 5:2). This &lt;em&gt;hope of glory&lt;/em&gt; is a certainty because of the mystery itself, which is &lt;em&gt;Christ in you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/q&gt; (92) The righteousness of Christ is counted to those who live by faith in him. W. G. T. Shedd writes in his &lt;em&gt;Dogmatic Theology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;q&gt;Christ’s perfect obedience which merits eternal life is not the sinner’s perfect obedience, but God imputes it to him: he calls or reckons it his.&lt;/q&gt; (Shedd, 700)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;paul-works-because-god-works&quot;&gt;Paul works because God works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final two verses of this short passage, Paul presents the reason for his labors, &lt;q&gt;that we may present everyone mature in Christ&lt;/q&gt; (v. 28) With this statement, Paul reflects Christ himself. As verse 22 reveals, reconciliation between God and humanity was achieved by Jesus by his death on the cross, &lt;q&gt;in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach.&lt;/q&gt; In other words, Christ reconciled us to God by imputing his righteousness to us &lt;em&gt;so that&lt;/em&gt; we may stand before God “holy and blameless and above reproach.” Paul labors steadfastly; God is at work and so he must be as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul ends the first chapter of Colossians&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on a high note: he gives all his energy—and truly it’s actually Christ’s energy imparted to Paul (&lt;q&gt;that he powerfully works within me&lt;/q&gt;)—to the stewardship he’s been given by God to proclaim the gospel to the Gentiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key message of these verses, I think, is that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is capable of Christian maturity in Christ—both Jew and Gentile. I’ll close with a quote from Wright’s commentary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then it is that the goal of maturity (not ‘perfection’ in the sense of sinlessness, as Phil. 3:13–14 makes clear) may be in sight. This goal is possible &lt;q&gt;in Christ&lt;/q&gt;: the Image of God himself now lives in his people by his Spirit (1:8), working secretly until their life and his are indistinguishable in their basic character, in true humanity (1:27; 3:10).&lt;/p&gt;

Developers tend to either love it or hate it—sometimes depending on the day. Well, here’s a reason to love it: CSS counters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we can simply use an ordered list to count items on a web page, but that doesn’t always fit semantically. And CSS counters are a bit more flexible than boring old lists, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-use-css-counters&quot;&gt;How to use CSS counters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using CSS counters, there are four properties and one function we can work with: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter-reset&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter-increment&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter-set&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;content&lt;/code&gt;, and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;counter-reset&quot;&gt;counter-reset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter-reset&lt;/code&gt; property to create our counter on the parent element of the items we wish to count. The property can accept two values: a counter’s name and a number from which to increment. The number value is optional and defaults to 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: The increment number can be a little confusing because the value provided is the starting point, so the first counted item will display the next incremented value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;counter-reset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;myCounter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;counter-reset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;myCounter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* Same result as above */&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;counter-reset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;myCounter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* Begin at 4 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter-reset&lt;/code&gt; can also reset an existing counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;counter-increment&quot;&gt;counter-increment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter-increment&lt;/code&gt; property defines the increment on the specified counter. This property can accept one or two values: either the name of a counter to increment or the name of a counter plus a number specifying the increment amount. If only the name of a counter is provided, the default increment of 1 is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;counter-increment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;myCounter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* 1, 2, 3, 4... */&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;counter-increment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;myCounter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* Same result as above */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#two&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;counter-reset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;yourCounter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#two&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.child&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;counter-increment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;yourCounter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* 3, 6, 9, 12... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;counter-set&quot;&gt;counter-set&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have defined our counters and their increments, we can &lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt; a starting point. That’s where &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter-set&lt;/code&gt; comes in. This property accepts a counter name and the starting value of the counter. The element it’s used on will be the starting point for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter-set&lt;/code&gt; value. Leaving the starting value out makes &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter-set&lt;/code&gt; default to 0. In cases where you might have multiple counters on an element, you can use multiple name-value pairs. You can also set &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter-set&lt;/code&gt; to none to cancel a less specific &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter-set&lt;/code&gt; style rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: We could leave out this property to let the counting start at the default of 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;counter&quot;&gt;counter()&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter()&lt;/code&gt; function returns a string representing the value of the specified counter. This is how our counter will be displayed visually. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter()&lt;/code&gt; function is generally used with pseudo-elements and the content property, but it could theoretically be used anywhere a string value is accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To display our counter, we need to provide the counter name to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter()&lt;/code&gt; function. The function accepts a second argument to define the style. Any valid &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;list-style-type&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; value is also valid here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;defining-custom-css-counters&quot;&gt;Defining custom CSS counters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the standard list-style-type values aren’t sufficient, you could define your own custom counter style with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@counter-style&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@counter-style&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CSS at-rule. From the MDN Web Docs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The initial version of CSS defined a set of useful counter styles. However, although more styles were added to this set of predefined styles over the years, this system proved too restrictive to fulfill the needs of worldwide typography. The @counter-style at-rule addresses this shortcoming in an open-ended manner, by allowing authors to define their own counter styles when the pre-defined styles aren’t fitting their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t get into &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@counter-style&lt;/code&gt; this time, but check out the tutorial on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quackit.com/css/at-rules/css_counter-style_at-rule.cfm&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@counter-style&lt;/code&gt; CSS at-rule&lt;/a&gt; over at Quackit. To see the rest of the CSS counter tools in action, take a look at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/collection/gYzzQv&quot;&gt;Codepen collection about CSS counters&lt;/a&gt;, and watch this &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/XFXVJBzsMCA&quot;&gt;video tutorial by Chris Coyier&lt;/a&gt; about ordered lists and CSS counters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using CSS counters is pretty easy once you understand the the few properties involved. I prefer CSS counters when the task is about styling. If you need proper list markup, this isn’t the method to use. (You’re probably looking for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-list-how-to-use-bullet-points-ordered-and-unordered-lists/&quot;&gt;HTML lists&lt;/a&gt;.)

Why did he dress in camel’s hair? What made him decide to live in the wilderness? Why was he mistaken for the prophet Elijah? The gospels make it clear that John was the appointed messenger to prepare the way for Jesus Christ. But why was his life so strange? It turns out, he was simply committing to his God-given mission, and he didn’t want anyone to miss the Messiah when he arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;god-chose-john-the-baptist&quot;&gt;God chose John the Baptist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John the Baptist was chosen by God to prepare the people for the ministry of Jesus. His purpose was clear, as the apostle John recorded in his gospel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 1:6–8 (&lt;abbr title=&quot;English Standard Version&quot;&gt;ESV&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prophet Isaiah received a message from God about John in Isaiah 40:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A voice cries:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;q&gt;In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;q&gt;Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;q&gt;And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Isaiah 40:3–5, ESV&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All four gospels reference this passage from Isaiah (Matthew 3:3, Mark 1:3, Luke 3:1–6, John 1:23).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John was transparent about who he was, but some people thought he was the Christ (Luke 3:15). He responded to these claims with the famous words comparing his own baptism of water to baptism by Jesus with the Holy Spirit and fire (Matthew 3:11, Luke 3:16, John 1:33). He continually used his ministry to point to Jesus. John was so passionate about preparing people for Jesus that his own disciples left him to follow the Master once he showed up. John himself pointed Jesus out to them (John 1:35–37).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-elijah&quot;&gt;Why Elijah?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John the Baptist was also mistaken&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for Elijah the Tishbite (John 1:21). But why Elijah? Whenever we read Scripture, it’s important to understand the context. John preached to a Jewish culture, and Jewish people knew the Scriptures, which for them was what we call the Old Testament. In the first chapter of 2 Kings, King Ahaziah recognized the prophet Elijah simply by a description of his clothing: &lt;q&gt;a garment of hair, with a belt of leather about his waist.&lt;/q&gt; (2 Kings 1:8, ESV) Elijah was well-known for his appearance, and John’s audience likely would have understood the reference, though many people still failed to see John the Baptist for who he was during his ministry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John the Baptist dressed in the same unique way as Elijah the Tishbite because he knew his calling: to “go before [Jesus] in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts” (Luke 1:17, ESV) of God’s people back to Him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last words from God before the birth of Jesus are recorded in Malachi 4:5–6, declaring that God will send Elijah the prophet to “turn the hearts” of His people. (It’s interesting that he’s referred to as &lt;em&gt;the prophet&lt;/em&gt; here rather than &lt;em&gt;the Tishbite&lt;/em&gt;, suggesting that the actual person of Elijah was not prophesied to prepare the way for Jesus.) These words are echoed by an angel in Luke 1:16–17 when John’s father, Zechariah, receives the news that he will have a son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John knew the calling on his life (Luke 1:67–79) and did everything he could to ensure that people didn’t miss who he was, and more importantly, who Jesus is. Malachi prophesied that God would send Elijah to prepare the way of the Lord, then 400 years later the angel Gabriel told Zechariah that his son would fulfill this prophecy. On either side of the intertestamental period between the Old and New Testaments is John the Baptist—first, his prophecy, then his appearance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it isn’t already clear who John the Baptist was, consider Jesus’ words to Peter, James, and John following His transfiguration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, &lt;q&gt;Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.&lt;/q&gt; &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; And the disciples asked him, &lt;q&gt;Then why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?&lt;/q&gt; &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; He answered, &lt;q&gt;Elijah does come, and he will restore all things. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands.&lt;/q&gt; &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 17:9–13, ESV&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew’s gospel records Jesus revealing John’s identity even before the transfiguration. In Matthew 11:7–15, John (from prison) sends his disciples to ask Jesus, &lt;q&gt;Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?&lt;/q&gt; (v. 3)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Jesus tells them to report what they see and hear Jesus doing. After John’s disciples leave, Jesus tells the crowd that John the Baptist is the one prophesied in Malachi 3:1&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and that &lt;q&gt;among those born of women no one greater than John the Baptist has appeared&lt;/q&gt; (v. 11). Verse 14 is the key verse for our purposes, though: &lt;q&gt;And if you’re willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who is to come.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;embrace-your-calling&quot;&gt;Embrace your calling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The life of John the Baptist is a great example of what God can accomplish through someone who embraces his or her calling. John lived in the wilderness (Luke 1:80) and dressed like Elijah the Tishbite because he knew that Isaiah and Malachi prophesied that he would prepare the people for “the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29, ESV)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you and I willing to go to such lengths for the sake of God’s mission?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It’s a bit confusing to read John the Baptist deny being Elijah early on, only to find out later that John actually was &lt;q&gt;the Elijah who is to come&lt;/q&gt; (Matthew 11:14). As Occam’s razor suggests, the simplest explanation is likely the correct one: John was not &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; the prophet Elijah. Many people of the time might have expected the return of the actual Elijah (Mark 8:28), since he was taken to heaven without dying (2 Kings 2:11). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a curious question coming from John the Baptist, who knew Jesus well. William Barclay, in &lt;em&gt;The Gospel of Matthew, Vol. 2&lt;/em&gt;, suggests three possible reasons for John’s inquiry: (1) It was for the benefit of John’s disciples. (2) John was growing impatient, expecting the Christ to be working faster. (3) As an outdoorsman imprisoned underground, John simply sought a fresh reassurance of his hope. I personally think reasons 1 and 3 make the most sense, and I’ll add a fourth possibility: (4) Knowing Jesus would likely be around a crowd when his disciples arrive, John asked the question already on the minds of many people—so that Jesus could answer it publicly. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;q&gt;I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come,&lt;/q&gt; says the Lord Almighty.&lt;/q&gt; (&lt;abbr title=&quot;New International Version&quot;&gt;NIV&lt;/abbr&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

Why did he dress in camel’s hair? What made him decide to live in the wilderness? Why was he mistaken for the prophet Elijah? The gospels make it clear that John was the appointed messenger to prepare the way for Jesus Christ. But why was his life so strange? It turns out, he was simply committing to his God-given mission, and he didn’t want anyone to miss the Messiah when he arrived.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The average color of the universe</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/martech/2021/average-color-universe" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The average color of the universe" /><published>2021-08-24T11:32:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-08-24T11:32:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/martech/2021/average-color-universe</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/martech/2021/average-color-universe">&lt;p&gt;In 2002, Ivan Baldry and Karl Glazebrook, professors from the U.K. and Australia, respectively, co-led a research study to measure the light emitted from tens of thousands of galaxies and developed a single spectrum of light to represent the entire universe. You can read about their research at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/average-color-of-universe.html&quot;&gt;Live Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that spectrum, the team also computed the average color of the universe: “a beige shade not too far off from white” called cosmic latte. Other suggestions by the research team included cappuccino cosmico, primordial clam chowder, and Big Bang beige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average color of the universe being beige may sound boring, but it makes sense. Combining all the wavelengths of visible light results in the color white, and the cosmic spectrum contains many different wavelengths. The research team also adjusted the colors in their spectrum to account for redshift, which causes light to appear more red as it stretches across space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cosmic latte may not be the flashiest color, but wouldn’t it be neat to use the average color of the universe in your next web or design project? Here are the color codes for cosmic latte:&lt;/p&gt;

There’s an entire SEO industry of professionals who spend 100% of their time optimizing websites for clients. But not everyone can afford to hire an SEO agency, so it’s helpful to have SEO terms explained in plain English for those of us who plan to get our hands dirty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re asking yourself, &lt;a href=&quot;2018-09-15-what-is-seo.md&quot;&gt;“What is SEO?”&lt;/a&gt; check out my article answering that very question. It’s important to understand what search engine optimization is and how to use that knowledge. Essentially, it boils down to this: SEO is the practice of making strategic and technical changes to a web page in order to position it to rank on search engine results pages (SERP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seo-terms-explained&quot;&gt;SEO Terms Explained&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a general understanding of search engine optimization, let’s see some SEO terms explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alt-attribute&quot;&gt;Alt Attribute&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alt attribute is used within the  tag to define an image in words. This is used by search engines to determine what a picture is in order to provide relevant search results to a user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This attribute also helps humans. When a browser can’t load an image for some reason, it will display the alt text in its place. If the text is descriptive enough, the person can get a sense of what the image should be. Alt text is also used by screen readers to describe images to visually impaired users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alt attribute is a great place to put a keyword that you want to rank for. It should still describe the picture, so using relevant pictures is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search engines like web pages with pictures because they’re typically more engaging to users, and it’s worth the effort to add alt attributes to your pictures. If a page contains an image without an alt attribute, the search engine doesn’t know what that picture represents. The page is then likely to rank worse because there’s a mysterious image that might not be relevant to a user’s search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anchor-text&quot;&gt;Anchor Text&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In HTML, an anchor is a hyperlink denoted with the a tag. The anatomy of a hyperlink includes the destination address (defined by the href attribute), any additional attributes, and the anchor text. Anchor text is the linked text content that’s visible on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;“https://brandoncaples.com/blog/seo/”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;What is SEO?&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anchor text is important for SEO, specifically for the destination address. The anchor text should ideally include a keyword important to the destination address. For example, a page linking to this blog post might call that link “SEO terms explained” or “SEO glossary” in order to help my post rank better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason it works this way is simple: social affirmation. If another website vouches for my page’s credibility as a good resource for “SEO terms explained”, then Google and other search engines can feel confident that it’s a helpful page to show for that search term. And the more “social affirmation” a page receives—multiple related websites linking to my page with similar anchor text—the greater the chance for an excellent page rank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;backlinks&quot;&gt;Backlinks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backlinks are web links coming to your site from other websites. Search engines used to rank websites according to their numbers of backlinks, but that algorithm was quickly exploited by people with dozens—even hundreds—of micro-sites that served no purpose except to link to a main site. The number of backlinks to your website is probably still a major factor, but the key is having quality backlinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you notice the word related in the last section? That’s important for quality backlinks. While you should strive to produce the kind of website that others want to link to, having a few dozen links from reputable, secure websites in your industry is much more preferable than having a lot of links from random, unsecured sites with no relation to what your website is about. For example, if you’re a food blogger trying to rank your website, you should want backlinks from restaurant websites, food truck associations, and other food blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search engines keep their algorithms under lock and key, so it’s hard to say just how important quality backlinks are, but there’s substantial evidence to suggest that backlinks are a primary pillar of search engine optimization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;canonical-reference&quot;&gt;Canonical Reference&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canonical reference is a tag that references a duplicate web page that should be considered more important than the current page. For example, say I want to reconfigure my URL structure to make blog post URLs shorter. (It’s widely believed that search engines prefer shorter URLs.) Since my blog posts have been indexed by Google for years, those URLs might have some pretty nice page ranks. I have a few options in this scenario:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep the old and new blog posts online, but add a noindex value to the old posts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove the old blog posts and redirect those URLs to the new blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep the old and new posts, and set canonical tags to the new URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding noindex to the old blog posts is a waste of page authority. Redirecting those old URLs will pass page rank onto the new URLs, but if redirection isn’t a viable option, using a canonical reference is a great solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duplicate content causes Google and other search engines to have to decide which of the duplicates is most helpful to searchers and should therefore be ranked. The likely winner is the older page; the other will get flagged as duplicate content, which will hurt the rank of the entire domain. But by placing canonical tags on the old pages, I can tell search engines that the new pages should get the ranking credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;click-through-rate-ctr&quot;&gt;Click-Through Rate (CTR)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A click-through rate (CTR) is the percentage of instances in which a searcher is shown a particular search result and clicks it. The click-through rate is a ranking factor for Google, because clicking a result after typing a keyword into the search bar tells the search engine, “Hey, this is what I was looking for.” The search engine then associates that web page a little more closely with the keyword used to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meta-description&quot;&gt;Meta Description&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meta description is the short paragraph that appears below the title of a search result. It describes the content of the page to the person searching. Google announced in 2009 that meta descriptions do not directly affect search engine rankings, but they can impact click-through rates. Think of the meta description as the elevator pitch for your web page. This elevator pitch should entice the person to click onto the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google increased the length of meta descriptions on its search engine results pages last year from about 160 characters to about 320 characters. Marketers were ecstatic. But only a few short months later, Google had changed its mind and reverted back, leaving people scrambling to shorten the descriptions they had just lengthened. I now recommend about 155 characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;robots&quot;&gt;Robots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google and other search engines inspect your web pages using robots—a.k.a. bots, spiders, or crawlers—that “crawl” pages and report on what they find. This helps search engines know what a page is about in order to show it to searchers on the search engine results page (SERP). These robots read all kinds of content and check for specific elements of a page to get information. If a particular piece of information is missing, it can affect how a page ranks on the SERP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search engine bots don’t have nearly the cognitive processing power of the human brain, so it’s crucial for search engine optimization that your web pages contain information that’s readable by robots. That’s why the SEO terms explained in this glossary are important. If a search engine can’t tell clearly what a page is about, it won’t rank that page well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;using-robotstxt&quot;&gt;Using robots.txt&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important way to communicate with search engine bots is with a document called robots.txt, which should be placed in the root directory of your website. If you’re using WordPress or another content management system (CMS), there are plugins and add-ons that can help you with this. However, you can avoid downloading a plugin if you have access to your website files and want to create this document manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;noindex&quot;&gt;noindex&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indexing is what happens when a search engine like Google lists a web page in its search engine results pages (SERP). But what if you don’t want a particular page to appear in search results? A prime example is a thank-you page that a user might see after completing a web form. It would be weird if someone accidentally stumbled onto your thank-you page when they haven’t interacted with your website before. Even worse, what if that page contains a download in exchange for contact information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is to add a noindex value to a robots meta tag. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;robots&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;noindex&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tells search engines not to index the page. It’s that simple. (You could also replace the value robots with a specific bot name, like googlebot, to allow every search engine except Google to index the page.) But you should &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-dont-mix-noindex-relcanonical/262607/&quot;&gt;never use both noindex and a canonical reference on the same page&lt;/a&gt;. According to Google’s John Mueller, this will force Google to choose which signal to honor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that noindex, and other search engine signals, are only requests. Google, Bing, and other reputable search engines will honor these requests, but other, less honorable bots can still crawl your site and see your pages. If you want to truly hide a page, it should be password-protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;nofollow&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you might need to link to another website without associating it with your own site. You can use nofollow for that. Using nofollow on a link tells search engines not to follow the link and pass link authority to the other web page. This is useful if the link leads to a nonsecure website, a site that’s not related to your industry, or if it’s a paid link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sitemap&quot;&gt;Sitemap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google and other search engines “crawl” the web by following links from one page to another and from one domain to another. If you have a new website with few, if any, links pointing to it, a sitemap will come in handy. A sitemap is an XML document written for robots that lists all the URLs of a website. Search engines will crawl your website if they can regardless of the the presence of a sitemap, but it helps them index a site’s pages quicker and keeps things organized. A sitemap acts kind of like a directory in the lobby of a large office building, pointing robots to where they should go and avoiding a page being missed if, for instance, there’s no link pointing to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document can be created in WordPress easily with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/&quot;&gt;Yoast SEO plugin&lt;/a&gt;. If your site isn’t built with WordPress, you can visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/&quot;&gt;XML-Sitemaps.com&lt;/a&gt; to create a sitemap. Next, you need to let search engines know about your sitemap by referencing it in your robots.txt file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Sitemap: https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can submit your sitemap to Google and other search engines directly. One thing to make sure of is that the information you’re giving to search engines is consistent. Don’t block a page in robots.txt and then list it in your sitemap. A sitemap should contain all the pages that should be indexed by a search engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;title-tag&quot;&gt;Title tag&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meta title is very important. It’s, well, the title of your web page. Like a book title, it sums up the whole web page. It tells everyone—humans and robots alike—what the page is about. Search engines use this basic piece of information to determine whether your web page is worth showing to a searcher seeking answers online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your meta title should be fairly short. Google tends to display titles between 50 and 60 characters. I recommend a meta title length of no more than 55 characters. You don’t want search engines to cut your title short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meta title should also contain the keyword you’re targeting for the page, preferably at the beginning of the title. The title will display on search engine results pages and in the browser tab when someone visits the page. This is how the HTML should be displayed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Here’s an Awesome Title | Brandon Caples&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many websites also place the title in the content of the page for viewers to see. If you want it on the viewable part of the web page, put it in an H1 tag:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Here’s an Awesome Title&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search engine optimization can be as simple as writing good content and linking to helpful resources, or as complicated as multiple lines of schema markup on every page of a website. Regardless of your particular approach to SEO, it’s helpful to know what these terms can mean for your website.&lt;/p&gt;
