David’s father assures him that, yes, this is real life. But for Christians, this is also eternal life. We’re living in it now.</p>

<h2 id="eternal-life-is-knowing-god">Eternal life is knowing God</h2>

<p>In John 17, Jesus defines eternal life as knowing God:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><sup>1</sup> Jesus spoke these things, looked up to heaven, and said, “Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you, <sup>2</sup> since you gave him authority over all people, so that he may give eternal life to everyone you have given him. <sup>3</sup> This is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and the one you have sent—Jesus Christ. <sup>4</sup> I have glorified you on the earth by completing the work you gave me to do. <sup>5</sup> Now, Father, glorify me in your presence with that glory I had with you before the world existed.</p>

  <p><cite>John 17:1–5, <abbr title="Christian Standard Bible">CSB</abbr></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This passage is the beginning of the longest recorded prayer of Jesus, and it’s filled with love for his disciples—all of us throughout history. As Gary M. Burge notes, <q>John 17 gives us a glimpse into the heart of Jesus unlike any other chapter in the four Gospels.</q> (<em>The NIV Application Commentary: John</em>)</p>

<p>There’s a lot to unpack in just these five verses, but one phrase that is often overlooked is, “This is eternal life: that they may know you” (v. 3). Louis Berkhof describes the nature of eternal life in his major theological treatise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reward of the righteous is described as eternal life, that is, not merely an endless life, but life in all its fulness, without any of the imperfections and disturbances of the present, Matt. 25:46; Rom. 2:7. The fulness of this life is enjoyed in communion with God, which is really the essence of eternal life, Rev. 21:3. They will see God in Jesus Christ face to face, will find full satisfaction in Him, will rejoice in Him, and will glorify Him.</p>

  <p><cite>Louis Berkhof, Systematic Theology</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eternal life is not simply living forever, nor does it begin once the faithful believer dies. The gift of eternal life is complete and everlasting union with the fullness of God in Jesus Christ, face to face. Even better, it begins in this life. If eternal life, as defined by the Christ himself, is to know God, then those of us who know God are experiencing it now. Eternal life for the Christian bleeds backward into time. Just as a door can be opened to let in the sunshine while a person is still inside, so too, can the Christian experience the warmth of the Son in this present life. And how much better to finally pass through that open door into the fresh air of God’s full glory? (Philippians 1:12)</p>

<h3 id="obstacles-to-experiencing-eternal-life-now">Obstacles to experiencing eternal life now</h3>

<p>There are many obstacles to experiencing the warmth of Jesus in this present life. To continue with the open door analogy, there’s a lot happening in this room. Life gets busy and distracting. Our bodies and minds are imperfect, plaguing us with physical and mental sicknesses. Anxiety, depression, cancer, eating disorders, insomnia. Evil abounds, striving always to turn our eyes and hearts away from Jesus.</p>

<p>These “imperfections and disturbances,” as Berkhof calls them, can be seriously heavy burdens. It would be dismissive to suggest that the person struggling with depression simply have more faith. God chooses to work primarily through his creation, and we’re not meant to live the Christian life alone. <q cite="Galatians 6:2, CSB">Carry one another’s burdens,</q> (Galatians 6:2, CSB) and allow others to carry yours. Seek professional help, if needed, to manage the things that prevent you from experiencing the Son of God presently.</p>

<h3 id="look-to-the-second-coming">Look to the second coming</h3>

<p>As Christians, our hope is found in Jesus and his second coming to restore all things.</p>

<p><q cite="1 Chronicles 16:11, CSB">Seek the Lord and his strength; seek his face always.</q></p>

<p>Like young David, many Christians are in a stupor and unable to watch and pray.

I’ll go a step further to say that every relationship you have is its own garden, including your relationship with Jesus.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We were constructed as social beings, made to live in vertical communion with God and horizontal communion with one another. Nothing works in life (let alone in marriage) when the human community is comprised of a bunch of self-appointed little sovereigns seeking to set up their own little kingdoms.</p>

  <p><cite>Paul David Tripp, Marriage: 6 Gospel Commitments Every Couple Needs to Make</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The weeds of any relationship garden can spring up out of selfish soil. This isn’t always the sinister, egoistic disregard for other people, but is often a slow process that grows out of comfort or convenience. Do you go out of your way to show (more than just speak) your love to your spouse? Is your relationship with your children engaging and constructive, or are you simply monitoring their activities? When was the last time you called your parents just to talk? Do you pray and read from God’s Word regularly?</p>

<p>These questions are convicting to me. But the way to pull the weeds of selfishness (and even prevent them) is to be intentional with our relationships. Moving to a new city just before the COVID-19 pandemic presented a relational challenge for my wife and me. In a new city where we knew no one, we were suddenly spending all of our time in our small family bubble, rather than attending church in person and forming relationships with other believers. The family time was great for our family, but we missed belonging to a faith community. Though we longed for a church home, I slowly became used to pandemic life and started getting comfortable living in a bubble.</p>

<p>In the first chapter of Jeremiah’s book, God calls him to be His voice to the people in order to draw them back to Himself. The people of Judah had strayed from knowing God. They were maintaining their religious identity, but it was rote. <q>They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water.</q> (2:13)</p>]]></content><author><name>Brandon Caples</name></author><category term="Faith" /><category term="relationships" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his book, Marriage: 6 Gospel Commitments Every Couple Needs to Make, Paul David Tripp compares marriage to a garden, which needs constant care to blossom, lest weeds spring up from inattention or flowers wither and die.

Maybe He’s just trigger-happy with His discipline and delights in handing out hardship to disobedient people. If you believe that God is sovereign (Job 40:2, 42:2; Proverbs 16:33; Isaiah 45:7–9; Lamentations 3:37–39; Matthew 10:29–31; Acts 4:27–28; Ephesians 1:11; Colossians 1:16–17), how does human suffering factor in?</p>

<p>It’s hard to know for certain if our suffering is the result of the Lord’s discipline (2 Samuel 12:14; Psalm 94:12; Proverbs 3:11–12; Jeremiah 30:11, 46:28; Hebrews 12:7–11), because of unseen spiritual forces (Job 1–2), or for His glory (John 9:1–3; Philippians 1:29; 1 Peter 4:12–13). The good news is, our suffering is not God’s desire. More poetically, He does not afflict from His heart (Lamentations 3:33).</p>

<p>In the time of the prophet Jeremiah, the people of Judah had become increasingly distanced from God (Jeremiah 9:6). They weren’t honoring Him, and even religious practices were empty (Jeremiah 7:1–10). They went so far as to worship false gods like Baal. Because of Judah’s waywardness, God tasked Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:17) with warning the people of their coming punishment if they didn’t turn back to the Lord.</p>

<h2 id="about-lamentations">About Lamentations</h2>

<p>The book of Lamentations is a poetic work of five chapters written, presumably, by Jeremiah in response to the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. at the hands of King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylonia. In Lamentations, each chapter is an acrostic poem. Chapters 1, 2, 4, and 5 all contain 22 verses, each beginning with a letter from the Hebrew alphabet, in ascending order.</p>]]></content><author><name>Brandon Caples</name></author><category term="Faith" /><category term="suffering" /><category term="Jeremiah" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you believe that God is sovereign, how does human suffering factor in?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">In the beginning was the Word: the prologue of John’s gospel</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/faith/2021/prologue-johns-gospel" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="In the beginning was the Word: the prologue of John’s gospel" /><published>2021-12-12T11:12:12-05:00</published><updated>2021-12-12T11:12:12-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/faith/2021/prologue-johns-gospel</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/faith/2021/prologue-johns-gospel"><![CDATA[<p>The prologue of John’s gospel is quite possibly the most beautifully profound passage of Scripture in the whole Bible—in both form and content.

<h2 id="textual-criticism">Textual criticism</h2>

<p>The first 18 verses of the fourth gospel set the stage for the remainder of the book’s events. In fact, the prologue could have been added by the apostle John after writing the rest of the book—a common belief found in many technical commentaries—as an introduction to its theological messages. Written in a poetic style, the introduction employs themes that John draws on throughout his gospel.</p>

<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p>The prologue of John’s gospel can be divided into four strophes—theological turns, or stanzas.</p>

<h3 id="the-first-strophe-the-word-and-god-112">The first strophe: the Word and God (1:1–2)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><sup>1</sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup>2</sup> He was with God in the beginning.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-second-strophe-the-word-and-creation-138">The second strophe: the Word and creation (1:3–8)</h3>

<p>Proverbs 3:19 Jesus is wisdom in the flesh.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><sup>3</sup> All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created. <sup>4</sup> In him was life, and that life was the light of men. <sup>5</sup> That light shines in the darkness, and yet the darkness did not overcome it. <sup>6</sup> There was a man sent from God whose name was John. <sup>7</sup> He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him. <sup>8</sup> He was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-third-strophe-the-word-and-revelation-1913">The third strophe: the Word and revelation (1:9–13)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><sup>9</sup> The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. <sup>10</sup> He was in the world, and the world was created through him, and yet the world did not recognize him. <sup>11</sup> He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. <sup>12</sup> But to all who did receive him, he gave them the right to be children of God, to those who believe in his name, <sup>13</sup> who were born, not of natural descent, or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man, but of God.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-fourth-strophe-the-word-and-incarnation-11418">The fourth strophe: the Word and incarnation (1:14–18)</h3>

<p>In the grand finale of the prologue of John’s gospel, the message moves to concrete images found in the Old Testament.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><sup>14</sup> The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup>15</sup> (John testified concerning him and exclaimed, <q>This was the one of whom I said, <q>The one coming after me ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.</q></q>) <sup>16</sup> Indeed, we have all received grace upon grace from his fullness, <sup>17</sup> for the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup>18</sup> No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and is at the Father’s side—he has revealed him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In verse 14, John makes a bold claim, one of the most important in all of Scripture: that God became a man and dwelt among his people and revealed his glory. The Greek verb for <em>dwelling</em> (σκηνόω, skēnoō) is also used in the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) to refer to God living among his people in the tabernacle in the desert. As Burge so eloquently puts it, <q cite="The NIV Application Commentary: John">the glory of God, once restricted to the tabernacle (Exodus 40:34), is now visible in Christ (John 1:14b).</q> (<em>The NIV Application Commentary: John</em>, p. 59) This shocking assertion combined into one two wholly separate entities for the Jew and Greek alike: the divine Spirit of God and the lowly flesh of mankind.</p>]]></content><author><name>Brandon Caples</name></author><category term="Faith" /><category term="Christ" /><category term="gospels" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The prologue of John’s gospel is quite possibly the most beautifully profound passage of Scripture in the whole Bible—in both form and content.

Developers tend to either love it or hate it—sometimes depending on the day. Well, here’s a reason to love it: CSS counters.</p>

<p>Of course we can simply use an ordered list to count items on a web page, but that doesn’t always fit semantically. And CSS counters are a bit more flexible than boring old lists, in my opinion.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-css-counters">How to Use CSS Counters</h2>

<p>When using CSS counters, there are four properties and one function we can work with: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counter-reset</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counter-increment</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counter-set</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content</code>, and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counter()</code> function.</p>

<h3 id="counter-reset">counter-reset</h3>

<p>We’ll use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counter-reset</code> property to create our counter on the parent element of the items we wish to count. The property can accept two values: a counter’s name and a number from which to increment. The number value is optional and defaults to 0.</p>

<p>Note: The increment number can be a little confusing because the value provided is the starting point, so the first counted item will display the next incremented value.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nf">#one</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="nl">counter-reset</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">myCounter</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="nl">counter-reset</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">myCounter</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">/* Same result as above */</span>
	<span class="nl">counter-reset</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">myCounter</span> <span class="m">3</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">/* Begin at 4 */</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As the name suggests, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counter-reset</code> can also reset an existing counter.</p>

<h3 id="counter-increment">counter-increment</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counter-increment</code> property defines the increment on the specified counter. This property can accept one or two values: either the name of a counter to increment or the name of a counter plus a number specifying the increment amount. If only the name of a counter is provided, the default increment of 1 is used.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nf">#one</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="nl">counter-reset</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">myCounter</span><span class="p">;</span>

	<span class="nl">counter-increment</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">myCounter</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">/* 1, 2, 3, 4... */</span>
	<span class="nl">counter-increment</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">myCounter</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">/* Same result as above */</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="counter-set">counter-set</h3>

<p>Now that we have defined our counters and their increments, we can <em>set</em> a starting point. That’s where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counter-set</code> comes in. This property accepts a counter name and the starting value of the counter. The element it’s used on will be the starting point for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counter-set</code> value. Leaving the starting value out makes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counter-set</code> default to 0. In cases where you might have multiple counters on an element, you can use multiple name-value pairs. You can also set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counter-set</code> to none to cancel a less specific <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counter-set</code> style rule.</p>

<p>Note: We could leave out this property to let the counting start at the default of 1.</p>

<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="counter">counter()</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counter()</code> function returns a string representing the value of the specified counter. This is how our counter will be displayed visually. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">counter()</code> function is generally used with pseudo-elements and the content property, but it could theoretically be used anywhere a string value is accepted.</p>

<h2 id="defining-custom-css-counters">Defining Custom CSS Counters</h2>

<p>If the standard list-style-type values aren’t sufficient, you could define your own custom counter style with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@counter-style"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@counter-style</code></a> CSS at-rule. From the MDN Web Docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The initial version of CSS defined a set of useful counter styles. However, although more styles were added to this set of predefined styles over the years, this system proved too restrictive to fulfill the needs of worldwide typography. The @counter-style at-rule addresses this shortcoming in an open-ended manner, by allowing authors to define their own counter styles when the pre-defined styles aren’t fitting their needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I won’t get into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@counter-style</code> this time, but check out the tutorial on the <a href="https://www.quackit.com/css/at-rules/css_counter-style_at-rule.cfm"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@counter-style</code> CSS at-rule</a> over at Quackit.

<p>Using CSS counters is pretty easy once you understand the the few properties involved. I prefer CSS counters when the task is about styling. If you need proper list markup, this isn’t the method to use. (You’re probably looking for <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-list-how-to-use-bullet-points-ordered-and-unordered-lists/">HTML lists</a>.)

Why did he dress in camel’s hair? What made him decide to live in the wilderness? Why was he mistaken for the prophet Elijah? The gospels make it clear that John was the appointed messenger to prepare the way for Jesus Christ. But why was his life so strange? It turns out, he was simply committing to his God-given mission, and he didn’t want anyone to miss the Messiah when he arrived.</p>

<h2 id="god-chose-john-the-baptist">God chose John the Baptist</h2>

<p>John the Baptist was chosen by God to prepare the people for the ministry of Jesus. His purpose was clear, as the apostle John recorded in his gospel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><sup>6</sup> There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. <sup>7</sup> He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. <sup>8</sup> He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.</p>

  <p><cite>John 1:6–8 (<abbr title="English Standard Version">ESV</abbr>)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The prophet Isaiah received a message from God about John in Isaiah 40:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A voice cries:</p>

  <p><sup>3</sup> <q>In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.</q></p>

  <p><sup>4</sup> <q>Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain.</q></p>

  <p><sup>5</sup> <q>And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.</q></p>

  <p><cite>Isaiah 40:3–5, ESV</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>All four gospels reference this passage from Isaiah (Matthew 3:3, Mark 1:3, Luke 3:1–6, John 1:23).</p>

<p>John was transparent about who he was, but some people thought he was the Christ (Luke 3:15). He responded to these claims with the famous words comparing his own baptism of water to baptism by Jesus with the Holy Spirit and fire (Matthew 3:11, Luke 3:16, John 1:33). He continually used his ministry to point to Jesus. John was so passionate about preparing people for Jesus that his own disciples left him to follow the Master once he showed up. John himself pointed Jesus out to them (John 1:35–37).</p>

<h2 id="why-elijah">Why Elijah?</h2>

<p>John the Baptist was also mistaken for Elijah the Tishbite (John 1:21). But why Elijah? Whenever we read Scripture, it’s important to understand the context. John preached to a Jewish culture, and Jewish people knew the Scriptures, which for them was what we call the Old Testament. In the first chapter of 2 Kings, King Ahaziah recognized the prophet Elijah simply by a description of his clothing: <q>a garment of hair, with a belt of leather about his waist.</q> (2 Kings 1:8, ESV) Elijah was well-known for his appearance, and John’s audience likely would have understood the reference, though many people still failed to see John the Baptist for who he was during his ministry.</p>

<p>John the Baptist dressed in the same unique way as Elijah the Tishbite because he knew his calling: to “go before [Jesus] in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts” (Luke 1:17, ESV) of God’s people back to Him.</p>

<p>The last words from God before the birth of Jesus are recorded in Malachi 4:5–6, declaring that God will send Elijah the prophet to “turn the hearts” of His people. (It’s interesting that he’s referred to as <em>the prophet</em> here rather than <em>the Tishbite</em>, suggesting that the actual person of Elijah was not prophesied to prepare the way for Jesus.) These words are echoed by an angel in Luke 1:16–17 when John’s father, Zechariah, receives the news that he will have a son.</p>

<p>John knew the calling on his life (Luke 1:67–79) and did everything he could to ensure that people didn’t miss who he was, and more importantly, who Jesus is. Malachi prophesied that God would send Elijah to prepare the way of the Lord, then 400 years later the angel Gabriel told Zechariah that his son would fulfill this prophecy. On either side of the intertestamental period between the Old and New Testaments is John the Baptist—first, his prophecy, then his appearance!</p>

<p>If it isn’t already clear who John the Baptist was, consider Jesus’ words to Peter, James, and John following His transfiguration:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><sup>9</sup> And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, <q>Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.</q> <sup>10</sup> And the disciples asked him, <q>Then why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?</q> <sup>11</sup> He answered, <q>Elijah does come, and he will restore all things. <sup>12</sup> But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands.</q> <sup>13</sup> Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.</p>

  <p><cite>Matthew 17:9–13, ESV</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="embrace-your-calling">Embrace your calling</h2>

<p>The life of John the Baptist is a great example of what God can accomplish through someone who embraces his or her calling. John lived in the wilderness (Luke 1:80) and dressed like Elijah the Tishbite because he knew that Isaiah and Malachi prophesied that he would prepare the people for “the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29, ESV)</p>

There’s an entire SEO industry of professionals who spend 100% of their time optimizing websites for clients. But not everyone can afford to hire an SEO agency, so it’s helpful to have SEO terms explained in plain English for those of us who plan to get our hands dirty.</p>

<p>If you’re asking yourself, <a href="2018-09-15-what-is-seo.md">“What is SEO?”</a> check out my article answering that very question. It’s important to understand what search engine optimization is and how to use that knowledge. Essentially, it boils down to this: SEO is the practice of making strategic and technical changes to a web page in order to position it to rank on search engine results pages (SERP).</p>

<h2 id="seo-terms-explained">SEO Terms Explained</h2>

<p>Now that you have a general understanding of search engine optimization, let’s see some SEO terms explained.</p>

<h3 id="alt-attribute">Alt Attribute</h3>

<p>The alt attribute is used within the  tag to define an image in words. This is used by search engines to determine what a picture is in order to provide relevant search results to a user.</p>

<p>This attribute also helps humans. When a browser can’t load an image for some reason, it will display the alt text in its place. If the text is descriptive enough, the person can get a sense of what the image should be. Alt text is also used by screen readers to describe images to visually impaired users.</p>

<p>The alt attribute is a great place to put a keyword that you want to rank for. It should still describe the picture, so using relevant pictures is important.</p>

<p>Search engines like web pages with pictures because they’re typically more engaging to users, and it’s worth the effort to add alt attributes to your pictures. If a page contains an image without an alt attribute, the search engine doesn’t know what that picture represents. The page is then likely to rank worse because there’s a mysterious image that might not be relevant to a user’s search.</p>

<h3 id="anchor-text">Anchor Text</h3>

<p>In HTML, an anchor is a hyperlink denoted with the a tag. The anatomy of a hyperlink includes the destination address (defined by the href attribute), any additional attributes, and the anchor text. Anchor text is the linked text content that’s visible on the page.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">“https://brandoncaples.com/blog/seo/”</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>What is SEO?<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Anchor text is important for SEO, specifically for the destination address. The anchor text should ideally include a keyword important to the destination address. For example, a page linking to this blog post might call that link “SEO terms explained” or “SEO glossary” in order to help my post rank better.</p>

<p>The reason it works this way is simple: social affirmation. If another website vouches for my page’s credibility as a good resource for “SEO terms explained”, then Google and other search engines can feel confident that it’s a helpful page to show for that search term. And the more “social affirmation” a page receives—multiple related websites linking to my page with similar anchor text—the greater the chance for an excellent page rank.</p>

<h3 id="backlinks">Backlinks</h3>

<p>Backlinks are web links coming to your site from other websites. Search engines used to rank websites according to their numbers of backlinks, but that algorithm was quickly exploited by people with dozens—even hundreds—of micro-sites that served no purpose except to link to a main site. The number of backlinks to your website is probably still a major factor, but the key is having quality backlinks.</p>

<p>Did you notice the word related in the last section? That’s important for quality backlinks. While you should strive to produce the kind of website that others want to link to, having a few dozen links from reputable, secure websites in your industry is much more preferable than having a lot of links from random, unsecured sites with no relation to what your website is about. For example, if you’re a food blogger trying to rank your website, you should want backlinks from restaurant websites, food truck associations, and other food blogs.</p>

<p>Search engines keep their algorithms under lock and key, so it’s hard to say just how important quality backlinks are, but there’s substantial evidence to suggest that backlinks are a primary pillar of search engine optimization.</p>

<h3 id="canonical-reference">Canonical Reference</h3>

<p>The canonical reference is a tag that references a duplicate web page that should be considered more important than the current page. For example, say I want to reconfigure my URL structure to make blog post URLs shorter. (It’s widely believed that search engines prefer shorter URLs.) Since my blog posts have been indexed by Google for years, those URLs might have some pretty nice page ranks. I have a few options in this scenario:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep the old and new blog posts online, but add a noindex value to the old posts</li>
  <li>Remove the old blog posts and redirect those URLs to the new blog posts</li>
  <li>Keep the old and new posts, and set canonical tags to the new URLs</li>
</ul>

<p>Adding noindex to the old blog posts is a waste of page authority. Redirecting those old URLs will pass page rank onto the new URLs, but if redirection isn’t a viable option, using a canonical reference is a great solution.</p>

<p>Duplicate content causes Google and other search engines to have to decide which of the duplicates is most helpful to searchers and should therefore be ranked. The likely winner is the older page; the other will get flagged as duplicate content, which will hurt the rank of the entire domain. But by placing canonical tags on the old pages, I can tell search engines that the new pages should get the ranking credit.</p>

<h3 id="click-through-rate-ctr">Click-Through Rate (CTR)</h3>

<p>A click-through rate (CTR) is the percentage of instances in which a searcher is shown a particular search result and clicks it. The click-through rate is a ranking factor for Google, because clicking a result after typing a keyword into the search bar tells the search engine, “Hey, this is what I was looking for.” The search engine then associates that web page a little more closely with the keyword used to find it.</p>

<h3 id="meta-description">Meta Description</h3>

<p>The meta description is the short paragraph that appears below the title of a search result. It describes the content of the page to the person searching. Google announced in 2009 that meta descriptions do not directly affect search engine rankings, but they can impact click-through rates. Think of the meta description as the elevator pitch for your web page. This elevator pitch should entice the person to click onto the page.</p>

<p>Google increased the length of meta descriptions on its search engine results pages last year from about 160 characters to about 320 characters. Marketers were ecstatic. But only a few short months later, Google had changed its mind and reverted back, leaving people scrambling to shorten the descriptions they had just lengthened. I now recommend about 155 characters.</p>

<h3 id="robots">Robots</h3>

<p>Google and other search engines inspect your web pages using robots—a.k.a. bots, spiders, or crawlers—that “crawl” pages and report on what they find. This helps search engines know what a page is about in order to show it to searchers on the search engine results page (SERP). These robots read all kinds of content and check for specific elements of a page to get information. If a particular piece of information is missing, it can affect how a page ranks on the SERP.</p>

<p>Search engine bots don’t have nearly the cognitive processing power of the human brain, so it’s crucial for search engine optimization that your web pages contain information that’s readable by robots. That’s why the SEO terms explained in this glossary are important. If a search engine can’t tell clearly what a page is about, it won’t rank that page well.</p>

<h4 id="using-robotstxt">Using robots.txt</h4>

<p>One important way to communicate with search engine bots is with a document called robots.txt, which should be placed in the root directory of your website. If you’re using WordPress or another content management system (CMS), there are plugins and add-ons that can help you with this. However, you can avoid downloading a plugin if you have access to your website files and want to create this document manually.</p>

<h4 id="noindex">noindex</h4>

<p>Indexing is what happens when a search engine like Google lists a web page in its search engine results pages (SERP). But what if you don’t want a particular page to appear in search results? A prime example is a thank-you page that a user might see after completing a web form. It would be weird if someone accidentally stumbled onto your thank-you page when they haven’t interacted with your website before. Even worse, what if that page contains a download in exchange for contact information?</p>

<p>The solution is to add a noindex value to a robots meta tag. It looks like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"robots"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">"noindex"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This tells search engines not to index the page. It’s that simple. (You could also replace the value robots with a specific bot name, like googlebot, to allow every search engine except Google to index the page.) But you should <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-dont-mix-noindex-relcanonical/262607/">never use both noindex and a canonical reference on the same page</a>. According to Google’s John Mueller, this will force Google to choose which signal to honor.</p>

<p>It should be noted that noindex, and other search engine signals, are only requests. Google, Bing, and other reputable search engines will honor these requests, but other, less honorable bots can still crawl your site and see your pages. If you want to truly hide a page, it should be password-protected.</p>

<h4 id="nofollow">nofollow</h4>

<p>Sometimes, you might need to link to another website without associating it with your own site. You can use nofollow for that. Using nofollow on a link tells search engines not to follow the link and pass link authority to the other web page. This is useful if the link leads to a nonsecure website, a site that’s not related to your industry, or if it’s a paid link.</p>

<h3 id="sitemap">Sitemap</h3>

<p>Google and other search engines “crawl” the web by following links from one page to another and from one domain to another. If you have a new website with few, if any, links pointing to it, a sitemap will come in handy. A sitemap is an XML document written for robots that lists all the URLs of a website. Search engines will crawl your website if they can regardless of the the presence of a sitemap, but it helps them index a site’s pages quicker and keeps things organized. A sitemap acts kind of like a directory in the lobby of a large office building, pointing robots to where they should go and avoiding a page being missed if, for instance, there’s no link pointing to it.</p>

<p>This document can be created in WordPress easily with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">Yoast SEO plugin</a>. If your site isn’t built with WordPress, you can visit <a href="https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/">XML-Sitemaps.com</a> to create a sitemap. Next, you need to let search engines know about your sitemap by referencing it in your robots.txt file:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Sitemap: https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml</code></pre></figure>

<p>Alternatively, you can submit your sitemap to Google and other search engines directly. One thing to make sure of is that the information you’re giving to search engines is consistent. Don’t block a page in robots.txt and then list it in your sitemap. A sitemap should contain all the pages that should be indexed by a search engine.</p>

<h3 id="title-tag">Title Tag</h3>

<p>The meta title is very important. It’s, well, the title of your web page. Like a book title, it sums up the whole web page. It tells everyone—humans and robots alike—what the page is about. Search engines use this basic piece of information to determine whether your web page is worth showing to a searcher seeking answers online.</p>

<p>Your meta title should be fairly short. Google tends to display titles between 50 and 60 characters. I recommend a meta title length of no more than 55 characters. You don’t want search engines to cut your title short.</p>

<p>The meta title should also contain the keyword you’re targeting for the page, preferably at the beginning of the title. The title will display on search engine results pages and in the browser tab when someone visits the page. This is how the HTML should be displayed:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Here’s an Awesome Title | Brandon Caples<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Many websites also place the title in the content of the page for viewers to see. If you want it on the viewable part of the web page, put it in an H1 tag:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Here’s an Awesome Title<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Search engine optimization can be as simple as writing good content and linking to helpful resources, or as complicated as multiple lines of schema markup on every page of a website. Regardless of your particular approach to SEO, it’s helpful to know what these terms can mean for your website.</p>
