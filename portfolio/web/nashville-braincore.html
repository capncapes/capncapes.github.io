		<p>I developed a custom WordPress theme for Batson ChiroHealth Group, which operates nashvillebraincore.com, to rebrand the product (BrainCore neurofeedback), give the site a fresh look, enhance its search engine optimization, and provide an online wellness community for Nashville BrainCore patients. I converted an existing site from Wix.com to WordPress to be more user friendly and accessible for the client. Special attention was paid to on-page search engine optimization, and a community forum was built, by client request, for verified Nashville BrainCore patients to sign in and share encouragements, therapy milestones, advice, etc.</p>
		<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
		<p>Batson ChiroHealth Group asked for a fresh look for the Nashville BrainCore website, and search engine optimization was a key focus from the beginning. Being familiar with the business, I suggested a social feature for patients to sign in and communicate with one another and with the neurofeedback practitioners.</p>
		<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
		<p>I needed to create a customizable homepage that converts visitors, looks great, and can be updated by staff with little knowledge of website management.</p>
		<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
		<p>I included a tab in the WordPress dashboard menu for updating the homepage. I ensured that user input was validated before submission to prevent input breaking the design. I also provided suggestions and basic training for editing.</p>
		<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
		<p>Batson ChiroHealth Group was very pleased with the final result and requested no changes.</p>
