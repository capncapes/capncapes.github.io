Hi, I’m Brandon. I live in Ooltewah, Tennessee (near Chattanooga) with my wife, our son, and our goldendoodle. I work in marketing for [Precept](https://www.precept.org/), with responsibilities like frontend web development, email coding, marketing automation, search engine optimization, and analytics.

I originally started brandoncaples.com in 2015 to host my résumé as I searched for jobs. Over the years, this site has mostly been a blog, though I wrote infrequently for much of that time. I relaunched the site in 2022 with a renewed focus on writing about my passions&mdash;[marketing technology](/martech/) and [biblical studies](/faith/). I'm also committed to reading more books, and I've added my own [book reviews](/book-reviews/) to the site.

As I continue to add new content to the blogs, I hope you'll check back often. Happy reading!
