Colosse) was in a small town located in the Lycus river valley, within the Phrygian region in Asia. Many scholars agree that it was likely Epaphras, not Paul, who planted and pastored the church. The letter addresses a heresy that had arisen, but specifics are not mentioned&mdash;only Paul's response, which is to affirm the deity of Jesus Christ and to establish Christ as central to the believer's life: &ldquo;the substance is Christ&rdquo; (2:17, CSB)."

The author identifies himself as Jude, the brother of James, who was the half-brother of Jesus. Jude's letter is a warning to the church against false teachers who have infiltrated the community. He describes these teachers as ungodly, immoral, and denying the Lord Jesus Christ. Jude calls on the church to contend for the faith and to remain faithful to the apostles' teaching."
