The prologue of John's gospel is quite possibly the most beautiful and profound passage of Scripture in the whole Bible&mdash;in both form and content. Gary M. Burge[^1] even asserts that John's prologue, originally sung as a hymn, was worn around the neck to prevent sickness, and recited to the sick and newly baptized.

## Themes

The prologue of John's gospel introduces profound theological themes that resonate throughout the entire gospel narrative. From the eternal preexistence of the Word to the Incarnation and the offer of grace and salvation, these themes invite readers to contemplate the profound mysteries of God's revelation and redemptive work in Jesus Christ.

### The Word (Logos)

At the heart of the prologue is the concept of the "Word" (Logos in Greek), which carries deep theological significance. Drawing from both Jewish and Hellenistic thought, John presents the Word as the divine agent through whom all things were created and who embodies God's wisdom and communication with humanity. This theme underscores the preexistence and divine nature of Jesus Christ as the eternal Word of God.

### Creation

Linked closely with the concept of the Word is the theme of creation. John declares that all things were created through the Word, emphasizing Jesus Christ's role as the divine agent of creation. This theme highlights Jesus' cosmic significance and reinforces the idea of his preexistence before the world began.

### Light and darkness

The prologue contrasts light and darkness as symbols of spiritual truth and ignorance, respectively. Jesus Christ is depicted as the true light that shines in the darkness of human sin and ignorance, offering illumination, guidance, and salvation. Despite the darkness's attempts to overcome it, the light of Christ remains victorious, symbolizing hope and redemption.

### Revelation and recognition

The prologue explores the theme of revelation, emphasizing Jesus Christ as the embodiment of divine truth and knowledge. Despite coming into the world he created, Jesus is often unrecognized and rejected by his own people. Yet, to those who receive him, he grants the privilege of becoming children of God, emphasizing the importance of faith and recognition in experiencing God's grace.

### Incarnation

At the core of the prologue lies the profound mystery of the Incarnation—the Word becoming flesh and dwelling among humanity. This theme encapsulates the astonishing truth of God's self-revelation in human form through Jesus Christ. The Incarnation signifies God's radical act of love and solidarity with humanity, bridging the gap between divinity and humanity and offering the promise of salvation and reconciliation.

### Glory and grace

Finally, the prologue emphasizes the themes of glory and grace. Jesus Christ is portrayed as the one who reveals the glory of God in his incarnate presence, full of grace and truth. Through Christ, believers receive grace upon grace, experiencing God's abundant and undeserved favor, which surpasses the limitations of the Mosaic law.

## Textual criticism

The first 18 verses of the fourth gospel set the stage for the remainder of the book's events. In fact, the prologue could have been added by the apostle John after writing the rest of the book&mdash;a common belief found in many technical commentaries&mdash;as an introduction to its theological messages. Written in a poetic style, the prologue employs themes that John draws on throughout his gospel.

Textual criticism of the prologue of John's gospel involves a meticulous examination of manuscript evidence, linguistic features, and compositional considerations. Despite minor variants and scholarly debates, the prologue remains a foundational passage, offering profound insights into the identity and significance of Jesus Christ as the Word made flesh. Through careful analysis, scholars continue to unravel the intricate layers of meaning within this timeless introduction to the fourth gospel.

### Manuscript evidence

The prologue of John's gospel enjoys relatively strong manuscript support, with early copies like Papyrus 66 and Papyrus 75 containing the prologue in its entirety. Additionally, early versions and translations, such as the Latin Vulgate and Syriac Peshitta, also attest to the presence of the prologue.

### Language and style

The introduction of John's gospel stands out for its elevated language and theological depth. Critics examine linguistic features, such as vocabulary and syntax, to discern the author's style and potential influences. Some scholars suggest Semitic influences on the Greek text, reflecting the author's Jewish background. The poetic structure and rhythmic cadence of the prologue further contribute to its literary richness.

### Interpolations

Textual critics also scrutinize potential interpolations or variants within the prologue. While the majority of the prologue's verses are well-attested and uncontroversial, there are minor textual variants in some manuscripts. For example, the placement of <q>the only begotten Son</q> in verse 18 varies in certain manuscripts, leading to debates among scholars about the original wording.

## Structure

The prologue of John's gospel can be divided into four strophes[^2]&mdash;theological turns, or stanzas. Each strophe builds upon the previous one, weaving together themes of divine preexistence, creation, revelation, and incarnation to present a comprehensive theological framework for understanding the identity and significance of Jesus Christ as the Word made flesh.

### The first strophe: the Word and God (1:1&ndash;2)

> <sup>1</sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup>2</sup> He was with God in the beginning.

The prologue opens with the majestic declaration of the eternal existence and divine nature of the Word (Logos). This Word, intimately associated with God from the beginning, is none other than Jesus Christ. Here, John lays the groundwork for understanding Jesus' preexistence and divine identity.

### The second strophe: the Word and creation (1:3&ndash;8)

> <sup>3</sup> All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created. <sup>4</sup> In him was life, and that life was the light of men. <sup>5</sup> That light shines in the darkness, and yet the darkness did not overcome it. <sup>6</sup> There was a man sent from God whose name was John. <sup>7</sup> He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him. <sup>8</sup> He was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.

Building upon the foundational assertion of the Word's divine nature, John portrays Jesus as the agent of creation. All things come into being through him, and he is the source of life and light. Even in the darkness of human sin and ignorance, his light shines, offering hope and redemption. Proverbs 3 comes to mind as we observe that Jesus is both Light and Wisdom, through whom the world was created.

> <sup>19</sup> By wisdom the Lord laid the earth’s foundations,<br>
>   by understanding he set the heavens in place;<br>
> <sup>20</sup> by his knowledge the watery depths were divided,<br>
>   and the clouds let drop the dew.
>
> <cite>Proverbs 3:19&ndash;20, <abbr title="New International Version">NIV</abbr></cite>

### The third strophe: the Word and revelation (1:9&ndash;13)

> <sup>9</sup> The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. <sup>10</sup> He was in the world, and the world was created through him, and yet the world did not recognize him. <sup>11</sup> He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. <sup>12</sup> But to all who did receive him, he gave them the right to be children of God, to those who believe in his name, <sup>13</sup> who were born, not of natural descent, or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man, but of God.

The arrival of the true light into the world marks a pivotal moment in history. Despite being the very Creator of the world, Jesus is often unrecognized and rejected by his own people. Yet, to those who receive him, he offers the transformative gift of becoming children of God through faith.

This strophe emphasizes the revelatory nature of the Word's coming into the world. It highlights the themes of recognition and rejection, as well as the offer of salvation to those who receive and believe in the Word, becoming children of God through faith.

### The fourth strophe: the Word and incarnation (1:14&ndash;18)

In the grand finale of the prologue of John's gospel, the message moves to concrete images found in the Old Testament.

> <sup>14</sup> The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup>15</sup> (John testified concerning him and exclaimed, <q>This was the one of whom I said, <q>The one coming after me ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.</q></q>) <sup>16</sup> Indeed, we have all received grace upon grace from his fullness, <sup>17</sup> for the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup>18</sup> No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and is at the Father’s side&mdash;he has revealed him.

In verse 14, John makes a bold claim, one of the most important in all of Scripture: that God became a man and dwelt among his people and revealed his glory. The Greek verb for *dwelling* (σκηνόω, skēnoō) is also used in the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) to refer to God living among his people in the tabernacle in the desert. As Burge so eloquently puts it, <q cite="The NIV Application Commentary: John">the glory of God, once restricted to the tabernacle (Exodus 40:34), is now visible in Christ (John 1:14b).</q> (*The NIV Application Commentary: John*, p. 59) This shocking assertion combined into one two wholly separate entities for the Jew and Greek alike: the divine Spirit of God and the lowly flesh of mankind. In Jesus Christ, the invisible God becomes visible, dwelling among his people in grace and truth.

## Conclusion

The prologue of John's gospel stands as a testament to the richness and depth of Scripture. Its poetic beauty and theological depth continue to inspire and challenge readers across generations. In these opening verses, John invites us to contemplate the eternal significance of Jesus Christ as the Word made flesh, the embodiment of God's love and truth in the world. As we journey through the gospel that follows, may we encounter anew the transformative power of the Word who became human for our salvation.
