Do you ever feel like God is waiting for you to fail so He can punish you? Maybe He's just trigger-happy with His discipline and delights in handing out hardship to disobedient people. If you believe that God is sovereign (Job 40:2, 42:2; Proverbs 16:33; Isaiah 45:7&ndash;9; Lamentations 3:37&ndash;39; Matthew 10:29&ndash;31; Acts 4:27&ndash;28; Ephesians 1:11; Colossians 1:16&ndash;17), how does human suffering factor in?

It's hard to know for certain if our suffering is the result of the Lord's discipline (2 Samuel 12:14; Psalm 94:12; Proverbs 3:11&ndash;12; Jeremiah 30:11, 46:28; Hebrews 12:7&ndash;11), because of unseen spiritual forces (Job 1&ndash;2), or for His glory (John 9:1&ndash;3; Philippians 1:29; 1 Peter 4:12&ndash;13). The good news is, our suffering is not God's desire. More poetically, He does not afflict from His heart (Lamentations 3:33).

In the time of the prophet Jeremiah, the people of Judah had become increasingly distanced from God (Jeremiah 9:6). They weren't honoring Him, and even religious practices were empty (Jeremiah 7:1&ndash;10). They went so far as to worship false gods like Baal. Because of Judah's waywardness, God tasked Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:17) with warning the people of their coming punishment if they didn't turn back to the Lord.

## About Lamentations

The book of Lamentations is a poetic work of five chapters written, presumably, by Jeremiah in response to the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. at the hands of King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylonia. In Lamentations, each chapter is an acrostic poem. Chapters 1, 2, 4, and 5 all contain 22 verses, each beginning with a letter from the Hebrew alphabet, in ascending order.
