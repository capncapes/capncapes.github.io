In his book, *Marriage: 6 Gospel Commitments Every Couple Needs to Make*, Paul David Tripp compares marriage to a garden, which needs constant care to blossom, lest weeds spring up from inattention or flowers wither and die. I’ll go a step further to say that every relationship you have is its own garden, including your relationship with Jesus.

> We were constructed as social beings, made to live in vertical communion with God and horizontal communion with one another. Nothing works in life (let alone in marriage) when the human community is comprised of a bunch of self-appointed little sovereigns seeking to set up their own little kingdoms.

The weeds of any relationship garden can spring up out of selfish soil. This isn’t always the sinister, egoistic disregard for other people, but is often a slow process that grows out of comfort or convenience. Do you go out of your way to show (more than just speak) your love to your spouse? Is your relationship with your children engaging and constructive, or are you simply monitoring their activities? When was the last time you called your parents just to talk? Do you pray and read from God’s Word regularly?

These questions are convicting to me. But the way to pull the weeds of selfishness (and even prevent them) is to be intentional with our relationships. Moving to a new city just before the COVID-19 pandemic presented a relational challenge for my wife and me. In a new city where we knew no one, we were suddenly spending all of our time in our small family bubble, rather than attending church in person and forming relationships with other believers. The family time was great for our family, but we missed belonging to a faith community. Though we longed for a church home, I slowly became used to pandemic life and started getting comfortable living in a bubble.

In the first chapter of Jeremiah’s book, God calls him to be His voice to the people in order to draw them back to Himself. The people of Judah had strayed from knowing God. They were maintaining their religious identity, but it was rote. <q>They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water.</q> (2:13)
