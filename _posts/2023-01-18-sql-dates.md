Working with dates in SQL is a pretty common task, and there are several date functions that we can use to query results and manipulate data.

## NOW()

The `NOW()` function simply returns the current datetime, like this: **{{ "now" | date: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" }}**. You will probably use `NOW()` a lot. If you only need the current date or the current time, use `CURDATE()` or `CURTIME()`, respectively.

## GETDATE()

The `GETDATE()` function works exactly like the `NOW()` function, except that `GETDATE()` returns milliseconds, too. The query result would look something like this: **{{ "now" | date: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%L" }}**.

## DATE()
`DATE(date)`

Use the `DATE()` function to extract the date from a valid date expression. The return format is **YYYY-MM-DD**. This is a useful function when handling mismatched date formats, especially if you don’t need to work with time.

## DATEADD()
`DATEADD(interval, number, date)`

The `DATEADD()` function is used to add (or subtract) two dates. The interval can be any of the following:

- year (also yyyy or yy)
- quarter (also qq or q)
- month (also mm or m)
- dayofyear (also dy or y)
- day (also dd or d)
- week (also ww or wk)
- weekday (also dw or w)
- hour (also hh)
- minute (also mi or n)
- second (also ss or s)
- millisecond (also ms)
- microsecond (also mcs)
- nanosecond (also ns)

The number parameter should be the number of the interval parameter needed, and it can be either positive (future) or negative (past).

The following example returns a date value that’s eight days in the past, from the current moment in time.

{% highlight sql %}
DATEADD(day, -8, GETDATE())
{% endhighlight %}

## DATEPART()
`DATEPART(interval, date)`

`DATEPART()` returns a specified part of a date. Use the interval parameter to specify the return value. The interval can be any of the following:

- year (also yyyy or yy)
- quarter (also qq or q)
- month (also mm or m)
- dayofyear (also dy or y)
- day (also dd or d)
- week (also ww or wk)
- weekday (also dw or w)
- hour (also hh)
- minute (also mi or n)
- second (also ss or s)
- millisecond (also ms)
- microsecond (also mcs)
- nanosecond (also ns)
- tzoffset (timezone offset, also tz)
- iso_week (ISO week, also isowk or isoww)

## DATEDIFF()
`DATEDIFF(interval, date1, date2)`

Use the `DATEDIFF` function to return the difference between two dates. The return value can be any of the following specified intervals:

- year (also yyyy or yy)
- quarter (also qq or q)
- month (also mm or m)
- dayofyear
- day (also dy or y)
- week (also ww or wk)
- weekday (also dw or w)
- hour (also hh)
- minute (also mi or n)
- second (also ss or s)
- millisecond (also ms)

The function starts with the first date provided, and the result can be either positive or negative depending on which direction in time the calculation moved.

{% highlight sql %}
-- Find all people older than 40.
DATEDIFF(NOW(), dob)/365 > 40
{% endhighlight %}

An important thing to remember when working with dates in SQL is that date formats need to match between the database column and the intended result. For a primer on working with SQL, check out my [introduction to SQL](/martech/2023/sql-intro).
