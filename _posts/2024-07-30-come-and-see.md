The call to <q>come and see</q> echoes throughout the scriptures, inviting us into a deeper understanding and relationship with God. This profound invitation is beautifully illustrated in both John 1 and Psalm 66, drawing us closer to the heart of God through a journey of exploration and faith.

## An Invitation to the Skeptical

> Shout for joy to God, all the earth!<br>
> <sup>2</sup> Sing the glory of his name;<br>
> make his praise glorious.<br>
> <sup>3</sup> Say to God, &ldquo;How awesome are your deeds!<br>
> So great is your power<br>
> that your enemies cringe before you.<br>
><sup>4</sup> All the earth bows down to you;<br>
> they sing praise to you,<br>
> they sing the praises of your name.&rdquo;<br>
>
><sup>5</sup> Come and see what God has done,<br>
> his awesome deeds for mankind!<br>
><sup>6</sup> He turned the sea into dry land,<br>
> they passed through the waters on foot&mdash;<br>
> come, let us rejoice in him.<br>
><sup>7</sup> He rules forever by his power,<br>
> his eyes watch the nations&mdash;<br>
> let not the rebellious rise up against him.
>
> <cite>Psalm 66:1&ndash;7, <abbr title="New International Version">NIV</abbr></cite>

This passage extends an invitation to all the peoples of the world, addressing the skeptical and the curious. It calls out to those who might doubt or question the power and presence of God. <q>Come and see</q> is a challenge to witness the mighty works of God, to observe the evidence of His deeds, and to be awed by His greatness.

## An Invitation to the Despairing

> <sup>8</sup> Praise our God, all peoples,<br>
> let the sound of his praise be heard;<br>
> <sup>9</sup> he has preserved our lives<br>
> and kept our feet from slipping.<br>
> <sup>10</sup> For you, God, tested us;<br>
> you refined us like silver.<br>
> <sup>11</sup> You brought us into prison<br>
> and laid burdens on our backs.<br>
> <sup>12</sup> You let people ride over our heads;<br>
> we went through fire and water,<br>
> but you brought us to a place of abundance.
>
> <cite>Psalm 66:8&ndash;12, <abbr title="New International Version">NIV</abbr></cite>

These verses speak to God's people, offering hope and encouragement to the despairing. Life's trials and tribulations are acknowledged, but so is the faithfulness of God in delivering His people. The invitation here is to see beyond the suffering, to recognize God's refining work, and to trust in His promise of deliverance and abundance.

## An Invitation to Sleepy Christians

> <sup>13</sup> I will come to your temple with burnt offerings<br>
> and fulfill my vows to you&mdash;<br>
> <sup>14</sup> vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke<br>
> when I was in trouble.<br>
> <sup>15</sup> I will sacrifice fat animals to you<br>
> and an offering of rams;<br>
> I will offer bulls and goats.<br>
>
> <sup>16</sup> Come and hear, all you who fear God;<br>
> let me tell you what he has done for me.<br>
> <sup>17</sup> I cried out to him with my mouth;<br>
> his praise was on my tongue.<br>
> <sup>18</sup> If I had cherished sin in my heart,<br>
> the Lord would not have listened;<br>
> <sup>19</sup> but God has surely listened<br>
> and has heard my prayer.<br>
> <sup>20</sup> Praise be to God,<br>
> who has not rejected my prayer<br>
> or withheld his love from me!
>
> <cite>Psalm 66:13&ndash;20, <abbr title="New International Version">NIV</abbr></cite>

In these verses, the invitation is personal and direct, calling out to those who may have become complacent or absorbed by the world's distractions. It is a wake-up call to cultural or worldly Christians, urging them to reawaken their faith, to remember God's deeds, and to actively participate in worship and testimony.

## &ldquo;Come and See&rdquo; in John 1:35&ndash;51

In the Gospel of John, the invitation <q>come and see</q> plays a crucial role in the calling of the first disciples. John the Baptist identifies Jesus as the Lamb of God, prompting Andrew and another disciple to follow Jesus.

> <sup>35</sup> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. <sup>36</sup> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, <q>Look, the Lamb of God!</q>
>
> <sup>37</sup> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.
>
> <sup>38</sup> Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, <q>What do you want?</q> They said, <q>Rabbi</q> (which means <q>Teacher</q>), <q>where are you staying?</q>
>
> <sup>39</sup> <q>Come,</q> he replied, <q>and you will see.</q>
>
> <cite>John 1:35&ndash;39, <abbr title="New International Version">NIV</abbr></cite>

This simple yet profound invitation extends to Nathanael, as well. When Philip tells Nathanael about Jesus of Nazareth, Nathanael is skeptical and asks, &ldquo;Can anything good come from Nazareth?&rdquo; Philip's response is straightforward: <q>Come and see.</q>

In both instances, <q>come and see</q> is more than an invitation to physically follow Jesus. It is an invitation to experience who He is, to witness His works firsthand, and to undergo a personal transformation. It is a call to move beyond skepticism and doubt, and to enter into a deeper relationship with Jesus.

This invitation remains relevant today. Just as the first disciples were invited to <q>come and see,</q> we too are called to experience the presence of Jesus in our lives. We are invited to bring our questions, our doubts, and our hopes to Him, and to see for ourselves the truth of His love and power.

## Embracing the Invitation

The phrase <q>Come and see</q> is an open invitation to everyone&mdash;whether you are skeptical, despairing, or feeling spiritually asleep. It beckons us to witness the works of God, to experience His faithfulness in the midst of trials, and to reignite our passion for Him.

In our daily lives, we can embrace this invitation by:

1. **Seeking God in His Word:** Dive into the scriptures to see the truth of God's promises and His mighty works.
2. **Observing God's work around us:** Pay attention to the evidence of God's hand in our lives and in the world around us.
3. **Sharing our testimonies:** Just as the psalmist and the disciples shared their encounters with God, we too should share our stories of faith and God's goodness.
4. **Engaging in worship:** Participate actively in worship, both personally and within our communities, to praise and honor God for who He is and what He has done.

<q>Come and see</q> is more than an invitation&mdash;it is a call to a transformative journey with God. Let us respond with open hearts and minds, ready to witness and experience the fullness of His love and power.
