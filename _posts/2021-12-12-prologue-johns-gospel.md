The prologue of John's gospel is quite possibly the most beautiful and profound passage of Scripture in the whole Bible&mdash;in both form and content. Gary M. Burge[^1] even asserts that John's prologue, originally sung as a hymn, was worn around the neck to prevent sickness, and recited to the sick and newly baptized.

## Textual criticism

The first 18 verses of the fourth gospel set the stage for the remainder of the book's events. In fact, the prologue could have been added by the apostle John after writing the rest of the book&mdash;a common belief found in many technical commentaries&mdash;as an introduction to its theological messages. Written in a poetic style, the introduction employs themes that John draws on throughout his gospel.

## Themes

## Structure

The prologue of John's gospel can be divided into four strophes[^2]&mdash;theological turns, or stanzas.

### The first strophe: the Word and God (1:1&ndash;2)

> <sup>1</sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup>2</sup> He was with God in the beginning.

### The second strophe: the Word and creation (1:3&ndash;8)

Proverbs 3:19 Jesus is wisdom in the flesh.

> <sup>3</sup> All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created. <sup>4</sup> In him was life, and that life was the light of men. <sup>5</sup> That light shines in the darkness, and yet the darkness did not overcome it. <sup>6</sup> There was a man sent from God whose name was John. <sup>7</sup> He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him. <sup>8</sup> He was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.

### The third strophe: the Word and revelation (1:9&ndash;13)

> <sup>9</sup> The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. <sup>10</sup> He was in the world, and the world was created through him, and yet the world did not recognize him. <sup>11</sup> He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. <sup>12</sup> But to all who did receive him, he gave them the right to be children of God, to those who believe in his name, <sup>13</sup> who were born, not of natural descent, or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man, but of God.

### The fourth strophe: the Word and incarnation (1:14&ndash;18)

In the grand finale of the prologue of John's gospel, the message moves to concrete images found in the Old Testament.

> <sup>14</sup> The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup>15</sup> (John testified concerning him and exclaimed, <q>This was the one of whom I said, <q>The one coming after me ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.</q></q>) <sup>16</sup> Indeed, we have all received grace upon grace from his fullness, <sup>17</sup> for the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup>18</sup> No one has ever seen God. The one and only Son, who is himself God and is at the Father’s side&mdash;he has revealed him.

In verse 14, John makes a bold claim, one of the most important in all of Scripture: that God became a man and dwelt among his people and revealed his glory. The Greek verb for *dwelling* (σκηνόω, skēnoō) is also used in the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) to refer to God living among his people in the tabernacle in the desert. As Burge so eloquently puts it, <q cite="The NIV Application Commentary: John">the glory of God, once restricted to the tabernacle (Exodus 40:34), is now visible in Christ (John 1:14b).</q> (*The NIV Application Commentary: John*, p. 59) This shocking assertion combined into one two wholly separate entities for the Jew and Greek alike: the divine Spirit of God and the lowly flesh of mankind.
