Launching a marketing campaign without a solid strategy is like baking a cake without a recipe. You might end up with something edible, but it's unlikely to be a masterpiece. In today's competitive world, a well-planned campaign strategy is the difference between attracting new customers and losing ground to the competition.

But first things first, you need to **identify the challenges** your organization faces. Is it brand awareness? Difficulty generating leads? A disconnect with your target audience? Understanding these roadblocks is crucial for crafting a campaign that actually addresses these challenges. To help with this process, ask some discovery questions:

- How well-known is your brand in your target market?
- Are brand messages resonating with your audience?
- What challenges does the organization face in gaining new customer awareness?
- Are you satisfied with the quantity and quality of leads generated?
- What conversion rates are you seeing from leads to customers?
- What marketing channels are most effective for lead generation?
- How satisfied are your customers with your products and/or services?
- Are your current customer engagement strategies effective?
- Do you think you have a strong understanding of your customers' needs and preferences?
- Are you meeting your sales and revenue targets?
- What are the biggest barriers to converting leads into customers?

Some business challenges may require additional investments beyond normal marketing budgetary items like advertising and content creation. Ask yourself these questions as well:

- Are there any internal inefficiencies that hinder your marketing efforts?
- Do you have the necessary resources and tools to execute your marketing plans effectively?
- What technology integrations or automation opportunities could improve your marketing operations?

Depending on your larger marketing goals, you may need to invest in additional staff and/or software. These are obviously significant financial ~~expenses~~ investments, so prioritize your needs and plan accordingly.

## Identify your target audience

Once you've identified a challenge to address, determine the target audience for the campaign. Who are you trying to reach? What are their needs, aspirations, and challenges? The more you understand their *language*, the more effectively you can connect with them.

An example of a target audience might be *repeat web visitors who haven't purchased* or *donors who give infrequently*.

## Define your business goals

Define your business goals clearly. Where do you want your marketing efforts to lead? Is there a particular problem area you'd like to address? Do you want to increase brand awareness, generate more leads, or boost donations for your nonprofit? Having a clear target in mind keeps your campaign focused and helps you measure its effectiveness.

Examples of business goals include *repeat web visitors completing their first purchase* or *adding donors to your monthly giving program*.

## Determine measurable <abbr title ="Key Performance Indicators">KPIs</abbr>

Think of KPIs (key performance indicators) as your trusty compass. They help you track your progress towards your goals. Will you track website traffic, social media engagement, or conversion rates? How do you know when you've achieved a goal? Choose measurable metrics that align with your goals and provide actionable insights.

An example of a measurable KPI might be, *increase web conversions by 2%* or *convert 5% of irregular donors to monthly givers*.

## Formulate a hypothesis

Every successful strategy starts with a well-informed guess. In marketing, this guess is your hypothesis. Think of it as a statement like, *Implementing a targeted social media campaign will increase website traffic by 15%.* This will guide your campaign development and allow you to test and refine your approach.

Other hypothesis statements may look like these:

- *We can increase web conversions by 2% for repeat web visitors by showing product recommendations.*
- *We can grow our pool of monthly givers by explaining the benefits of expected revenue to our nonprofit and by offering incentives to monthly givers.*

## Review necessary content

Now it's time to take an inventory of your content needs. What type of content will resonate with your target audience? Blog posts, infographics, videos, or social media interactions? What resources are readily available? What content needs to be created to support your campaign? Choose formats that align with your hypothesis and audience preferences.
