Every organization, from bustling startups to established giants, needs a guiding light. This isn't just about turning a profit; it's about understanding the *why* behind your existence, the *how* that defines your character, and the *what* that sets you apart. In short, it's about discovering your organizational purpose.

Unraveling this purpose isn't always straightforward, but it's a journey worth taking. And there's a roadmap to guide you to better understanding your organization and your stakeholders. With only five basic questions, you can uncover your organizational purpose.

## Why do we exist?

This is your big-picture vision. It's the reason you were created in the first place, the impact you want to make on the world&mdash;**your mission**. Is it to revolutionize healthcare? To empower communities? To inspire creativity? Whatever it is, it should be bigger than just selling a product or service.

## How do we behave?

Behaviors reflect **values**. These are the guiding principles that underpin your actions. They define how you interact with stakeholders, make decisions, and navigate challenges. Are you collaborative, innovative, customer-centric? Embracing these values fosters a strong internal culture and attracts like-minded people to your cause.

## What do we do?

What is it that your organization does? **Products and services** are the tangible expression of your mission and values&mdash;the problems you solve, the needs you fulfill. But remember, it's not just about what you do, but why you do it. How do your offerings align with your broader purpose?

## How will we succeed?

Every journey needs a destination. This is your main organizational goal, the mountain you're striving to climb. It could be achieving market leadership, exceeding customer satisfaction, or making a significant social impact. Define your success metric and keep it visible, reminding yourself and your team what you're working towards.

## What is most important now?

With a clear long-term goal, it's time to break it down into actionable steps. What are the key milestones you need to achieve in the next twelve months? What projects will drive you closer to your mountain peak? This short-term focus keeps your team motivated and ensures you're making steady progress towards your ultimate vision.

Remember, uncovering your organizational purpose is an ongoing process. It's not a one-time declaration, but a living document that evolves with your organization's growth and the changing landscape around you. By regularly revisiting these questions, you'll stay aligned, inspired, and on track to achieving your true potential.
