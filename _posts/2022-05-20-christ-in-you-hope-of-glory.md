Is there a Christian teacher whom you greatly respect but have never met? How would it feel to receive a personal letter from that person commending you for your faith and revealing their prayers for you? That is how the church in Colossae must have felt to receive a letter from the apostle Paul. By the time he wrote Colossians, Paul was well-known in the growing Christian movement, and Colossae was a small city with little influence.

Paul did not plant the Colossian church; he likely never even visited it. But he had heard about their "faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints" (1:4) through Epaphras. Epaphras is probably the one who started the Colossian church, and the minister of Christ who "told us about your love in the Spirit." (1:8)
